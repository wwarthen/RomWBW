OVERVIEW


RomWBW software provides a complete, commercial quality implementation
of CP/M (and workalike) operating systems and applications for modern
Z80/180/280 retro-computing hardware systems. A wide variety of
platforms are supported including those produced by these developer
communities:

-   RetroBrew Computers (https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org)
-   RC2014 (https://rc2014.co.uk),
    RC2014-Z80 (https://groups.google.com/g/rc2014-z80)
-   Retro Computing (https://groups.google.com/g/retro-comp)
-   Small Computer Central (https://smallcomputercentral.com/)

A complete list of the currently supported platforms is found in the
[Installation] section.

General features include:

-   Z80 Family CPUs including Z80, Z180, and Z280
-   Banked memory services for several banking designs
-   Disk drivers for RAM, ROM, Floppy, IDE ATA/ATAPI, CF, SD, USB, Zip,
    Iomega
-   Serial drivers including UART (16550-like), ASCI, ACIA, SIO
-   Video drivers including TMS9918, SY6545, MOS8563, HD6445
-   Keyboard (PS/2) drivers via VT8242 or PPI interfaces
-   Real time clock drivers including DS1302, BQ4845
-   OSes: CP/M 2.2, ZSDOS, CP/M 3, NZ-COM, ZPM3, QPM, p-System, and
    FreeRTOS
-   Built-in VT-100 terminal emulation support

RomWBW is distributed as both source code and pre-built ROM and disk
images. Some of the provided software can be launched directly from the
ROM firmware itself:

-   System Monitor
-   Operating Systems (CP/M 2.2, ZSDOS)
-   ROM BASIC (Nascom BASIC and Tasty BASIC)
-   ROM Forth

A dynamic disk drive letter assignment mechanism allows mapping
operating system drive letters to any available disk media.
Additionally, mass storage devices (IDE Disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.)
support the use of multiple slices (up to 256 per device). Each slice
contains a complete CP/M filesystem and can be mapped independently to
any drive letter. This overcomes the inherent size limitations in legacy
OSes and allows up to 2GB of accessible storage on a single device.

The pre-built ROM firmware images are generally suitable for most users.
However, it is also very easy to modify and build custom ROM images that
fully tailor the firmware to your specific preferences. All tools
required to build custom ROM firmware under Windows are included – no
need to install assemblers, etc. The firmware can also be built using
Linux or MacOS after confirming a few standard tools have been
installed.

Multiple disk images are provided in the distribution. Most disk images
contain a complete, bootable, ready-to-run implementation of a specific
operating system. A “combo” disk image contains multiple slices, each
with a full operating system implementation. If you use this disk image,
you can easily pick whichever operating system you want to boot without
changing media.

By design, RomWBW isolates all of the hardware specific functions in the
ROM chip itself. The ROM provides a hardware abstraction layer such that
all of the operating systems and applications on a disk will run on any
RomWBW-based system. To put it simply, you can take a disk (or CF/SD/USB
Card) and move it between systems transparently.

A tool is provided that allows you to access a FAT-12/16/32 filesystem.
The FAT filesystem may be coresident on the same disk media as RomWBW
slices or on stand-alone media. This makes exchanging files with modern
OSes such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux very easy.



ACQUIRING ROMWBW


The RomWBW Repository (https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW) on GitHub is
the official distribution location for all project source and
documentation. The fully-built distribution releases are available on
the RomWBW Releases Page (https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases)
of the repository. On this page, you will normally see a Development
Snapshot as well as recent stable releases. Unless you have a specific
reason, I suggest you stick to the most recent stable release. Expand
the “Assets” drop-down for the release you want to download, then select
the asset named RomWBW-vX.X.X-Package.zip. The Package asset includes
all pre-built ROM and Disk images as well as full source code. The other
assets contain only source code and do not have the pre-built ROM or
disk images.

All source code and distributions are maintained on GitHub. Code
contributions are very welcome.



INSTALLATION & OPERATION


In general, installation of RomWBW on your platform is very simple. You
just need to program your ROM with the correct ROM image from the RomWBW
distribution. Subsequently, you can write disk images on your disk
drives (IDE disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.) which then provides even more
functionality.

Complete instructions for installation and operation of RomWBW are found
in the RomWBW User Guide.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS


I want to acknowledge that a great deal of the code and inspiration for
RomWBW has been provided by or derived from the work of others in the
RetroBrew Computers Community. I sincerely appreciate all of their
contributions. The list below is probably missing many names – please
let me know if I missed you!

-   Andrew Lynch started it all when he created the N8VEM Z80 SBC which
    became the first platform RomWBW supported. Some of his original
    code can still be found in RomWBW.

-   Dan Werner wrote much of the code from which RomWBW was originally
    derived and he has always been a great source of knowledge and
    advice.

-   Douglas Goodall contributed code, time, testing, and advice in “the
    early days”. He created an entire suite of application programs to
    enhance the use of RomWBW. Unfortunately, they have become unusable
    due to internal changes within RomWBW. As of RomWBW 2.6, these
    applications are no longer provided.

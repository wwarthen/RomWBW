<p><strong>RomWBW Applications Guide</strong> \
Version 3.6 \
MartinR \&amp; Phillip Summers  (<a href="mailto:"></a>) \
31 May 2025</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>RomWBW is supplied with a suite of software applications that enhance
the use of the system. Some of these applications have been written
entirely from scratch for RomWBW. Others are pre-existing software that
has been customized for the RomWBW environment. This document serves as
a reference for these RomWBW-specific applications.</p>
<p>The primary usage documentation for RomWBW is the <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20User%20Guide.pdf">RomWBW User
Guide</a>.
It is assumed that the reader is generally familiar with this document.</p>
<p>RomWBW also includes many generic software applications that have not
been modified for RomWBW (e.g., MSBASIC). These generic applications are
not documented here. Please refer to the application specific
documentation for these generic applications. The documentation for some
of these generic applications is included in the Doc folder of the
RomWBW distribution.</p>
<p>The applications described in this document fall into two general
categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>ROM Applications</strong> are software applications that are loaded from
    the the ROM memory of your RomWBW system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CP/M Applications</strong> are software applications that are loaded from
    disk using a previously loaded CP/M (or CP/M like) operating system
    using its command line.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that some applications are available in both forms. For example,
Microsoft BASIC is available as a ROM application and as an application
that runs under CP/M. Only the ROM variant is documented here because
the CP/M variant is not RomWBW-specific.</p>
<p>You will see that two of the RomWBW operating systems are included here
as ROM Applications. Although operating systems are normally loaded from
disk, RomWBW does include a way to launch CP/M 2.2 and Z-System directly
from ROM.</p>
<p>Most RomWBW systems include a ROM disk. A running operating system can
load applications from the ROM disk just like a floppy or hard disk.
Applications loaded from the ROM disk by CP/M are considered to be CP/M
applications, <strong>not</strong> ROM applications.</p>
<h1 id="boot-menu">Boot Menu</h1>
<p>The system start-up process is described in some detail in the RomWBW
User Guide, and for the sake of completeness there is some overlap here.</p>
<p>When a RomWBW system is started the user is presented with a sign-on
message at the default console detailing the RomWBW version and build
date. The system follows this with the list of hardware that it has
discovered, a list of devices and the system units assigned to them,
before finally inviting the to select a boot device with the prompt:</p>
<pre><code>Boot [H=Help]:
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, the user may specify a unit, optionally with a slice, to
boot from. Note that it is not possible to boot from from the serial
(ASCI) or memory disk (MD) devices.</p>
<p>Alternatively the user may select one of the built-in Boot Loader
commands. A menu of which may be displayed by pressing the H or ? keys
(for Help). Furthermore, a ROM application may also be started from this
prompt.</p>
<p>This start-up process is described in some detailed in the RomWBW User
Guide, and there is some overlap here.</p>
<h2 id="help">Help</h2>
<p>After pressing H or ? at the boot prompt the user will be presented with
the following list of available commands:</p>
<pre><code>L           - List ROM Applications
D           - Device Inventory
R           - Reboot System
I &lt;u&gt; [&lt;c&gt;] - Set Console Interface/Baud code
V [&lt;n&gt;]     - View/Set HBIOS Diagnostic Verbosity
&lt;u&gt;[.&lt;s&gt;]   - Boot Disk Unit/Slice
</code></pre>
<p>The function performed by each command is described below:</p>
<p>L:<br />
Lists the applications and operating systems that are built into the
RomWBW ROM - e.g., low-level monitor utility, CP/M, or BASIC.</p>
<p>D:<br />
Displays the list of system devices that was first displayed when the
system was started.</p>
<p>R:<br />
Will restart the system. Note that this does not reset hardware devices
in the same way that power-on or pressing the reset button would.</p>
<p>I:<br />
Allows the user to select the interface connected to the console, and
optionally the Baud rate. This could be used to allow the system to be
operated from a second console.</p>
<p>V:<br />
Enables the display of invalid RomWBW HBIOS API calls. This option is
very unlikely to be used by a user and is used for development purposes.</p>
<p>And, finally, the system may be booted by specifying the unit number,
and optional slice, separated by a period(‘.’), of where the disk
operating system software is located - eg 2, 4.1, 5.3</p>
<p>Alternatively, a RomWBW ROM application may be started by pressing the
appropriate key from the applications menu, shown in the following
section.</p>
<h2 id="list-rom-applications">List ROM Applications</h2>
<p>If the user presses the L key at the Boot Loader prompt then the system
will display the list of ROM applications that are built into RomWBW. If
a command letter is known, then it may be entered directly at the prompt
rather than first displaying the menu.</p>
<p>The ROM applications available from the boot prompt are:</p>
<pre><code>M: Monitor
C: CP/M 2.2
Z: Z-System
B: BASIC
T: Tasty BASIC
F: Forth
P: Play a Game
N: Network Boot
X: XModem Flash Updater
U: User App
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these will now be described in greater detail.</p>
<h1 id="rom-applications">ROM Applications</h1>
<h2 id="monitor">Monitor</h2>
<p>The Monitor program is a low-level utility that can be used for testing
and programming. It allows programs to be entered, memory to be examined
and modified, and input/output devices to be read or written to.</p>
<p>It’s key advantage is that is available at boot up.</p>
<p>Its key disadvantages are that code cannot be entered in assembly
language and there is no ability to save to persistent storage (disks).</p>
<p>The available memory area for programming is <code>0100h-EDFFh</code>. The
following areas are reserved:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Memory Area</th>
<th>Function</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>0000-00FFh</code></td>
<td>Jump and restart (RST) vectors</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>EE00-FDFFh</code></td>
<td>Monitor</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>FE00-FFFFh</code></td>
<td>HBIOS proxy</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The monitor uses a prompt in the format of <code>xx&gt;</code> where xx is the RomWBW
bank id number. For example, the prompt may look like this and means
that Bank Id 0x8E is currently mapped into the low 32K of processor
memory.</p>
<p><code>8E&gt;</code></p>
<p>Please refer to Section 4 of the \$doc_sys# for a description of the
RomWBW Bank Id and how it relates to the physical bank of memory being
mapped to the lower 32K of the processor. The method of assigning banks
for specific RomWBW functions is also described.</p>
<p>Commands can be entered at the command prompt. Automatic case conversion
takes place on command entry and all numeric arguments are expected to
be in hex format.</p>
<p>The Monitor allows access to all memory locations but ROM and Flash
memory cannot be written to. At startup, the Monitor will select the
default “User” bank. The <code>S</code> command is provided to allow selecting
alternate banks.</p>
<p>There now follows a more detailed guide to using the RomWBW Monitor
program:</p>
<h3 id="command-summary">Command Summary</h3>
<p><strong><code>?</code></strong> - Will display a summary of the available commands.</p>
<pre><code>Monitor Commands (all values in hex):
B                    - Boot system
D xxxx [yyyy]        - Dump memory from xxxx to yyyy
F xxxx yyyy zz       - Fill memory from xxxx to yyyy with zz
H                    - Halt system
I xxxx               - Input from port xxxx
K                    - Keyboard echo
L                    - Load Intel hex data
M xxxx yyyy zzzz     - Move memory block xxxx-yyyy to zzzz
O xxxx yy            - Output value yy to port xxxx
P xxxx               - Program RAM at address xxxx
R xxxx [[yy] [zzzz]] - Run code at address xxxx
                       Pass yy and zzzz to register A and BC
S xx                 - Set bank to xx
U                    - Set bank to previous bank
T xxxx               - X-modem transfer to memory location xxxx
X                    - Exit monitor
</code></pre>
<h3 id="cold-boot">Cold Boot</h3>
<p><strong><code>B</code></strong> - Performs a cold boot of the RomWBW system. A complete
re-initialization of the system is performed and the system returns to
the Boot Loader prompt.</p>
<h3 id="dump-memory">Dump Memory</h3>
<p><strong><code>D xxxx [yyyy]</code></strong> - Dump memory from hex location xxxx to yyyy on the
screen as lines of 16 hexadecimal bytes with their ASCII equivalents (if
within a set range, else a ‘.’ is printed). If the end address is
omitted then 256 bytes are displayed.</p>
<p>A good tool to see where code is located, check for version id, obtain
details for chip configurations and execution paths.</p>
<p>Example: <code>D 100 1FF</code></p>

</code></pre>
<h3 id="fill-memory">Fill Memory</h3>
<p><strong><code>F xxxx yyyy zz</code></strong> - Fill memory from hex xxxx to yyyy with a single
value of zz over the full range. The Dump command can be used to confirm
that the fill completed as expected. A good way to zero out memory areas
before writing machine data for debug purposes.</p>
<h3 id="halt-system">Halt System</h3>
<p><strong><code>H</code></strong> - Halt system. A Z80 HALT instruction is executed. The system
remains in the halt state until the system is physically rebooted.
Interrupts will not restart the system. On systems that support a HALT
status LED, the LED will be illuminated.</p>
<h3 id="input-from-port">Input from Port</h3>
<p><strong><code>I xxxx</code></strong> - Input data from port xxxx and display to the screen. This
command is used to read values from hardware I/O ports and display the
contents in hexadecimal.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-echo">Keyboard Echo</h3>
<p><strong><code>K</code></strong> - Echo any key-presses from the terminal. Press ‘ESC’ key to
quit. This facility provides that any key stroke sent to the computer
will be echoed back to the terminal. File down loads will be echoed as
well while this facility is ‘on’.</p>
<h3 id="load-hex">Load Hex</h3>
<p><strong><code>L</code></strong> - Load a Intel Hex data via the terminal program. The load
address is defined in the hex file of the assembled code.</p>
<p>The terminal emulator program should be configured to give a delay at
the end of each line to allow the monitor enough time to parse the line
and move the data to memory.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that this will be transient unless the system supports
battery backed memory. Saving to memory drive is not supported.</p>
<h3 id="move-memory">Move Memory</h3>
<p><strong><code>M xxxx yyyy zzzz</code></strong> - Move hex memory block xxxx to yyyy to memory
starting at hex location zzzz. Care should be taken to insure that there
is enough memory at the destination so that code does not get
over-written or memory wrapped around.</p>
<h3 id="output-to-port">Output to Port</h3>
<p><strong><code>O xxxx yy</code></strong> - Output data byte xx to port xxxx. This command is used
to send hexadecimal values to hardware I/O ports to verify their
operation and is the companion to the I operation. Use clip leaded LEDs
to confirm the data written.</p>
<h3 id="program-memory">Program Memory</h3>
<p><strong><code>P xxxx</code></strong> - Program memory location xxxx. This routine will allow you
to program a hexadecimal value ‘into memory starting at location xxxx.
Press ’Enter’ on a blank line to return to the Monitor prompt.</p>
<p>The limitation around programming memory is that it must be entered in
hexadecimal. An alternative is to use the L command to load a program
that has been assembled to a hex file on the remote computer.</p>
<p>An excellent online resource for looking up opcodes for entry can be
found here: <a href="https://clrhome.org/table">https://clrhome.org/table</a>.</p>
<h3 id="run-program">Run Program</h3>
<p><strong><code>R xxxx [[yy] [zzzz]]</code></strong> - Run program at location xxxx. If optional
arguments yy and zzzz are entered they are loaded into the A and BC
register respectively. The return address of the Monitor is saved on the
stack so the program can return to the monitor. On return to the
monitor, the contents of the A, HL, DE and BC registers are displayed.</p>
<h3 id="set-bank">Set Bank</h3>
<p><strong><code>S xx</code></strong> - Set the physical memory bank to the RomWBW Bank Id
indicated by xx. Memory addresses 0x0000-0x7FFF (i.e. bottom 32k) are
affected. Because the interrupt vectors are stored in the bottom page of
this range, this function is disabled when interrupt mode 1 is being
used (IM1). Interrupt mode 2 is not affected as the associated jump
vectors are stored in high memory.</p>
<p>Changing the bank also impacts the restart vectors (RST), so executing
code that calls the HBIOS using the <code>RST 08</code> assembly code will not
work.</p>
<p>The monitor stack resides in high memory and is not affected but any
code that changes the stack to low memory will be affected.</p>
<p>The U command may be used to undo the change and return the selected
memory bank back to the previously selected one.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20System%20Guide.pdf">RomWBW System
Guide</a>
provides detail on how Bank Ids map to the physical memory of the system
and also how specific banks are utilized by RomWBW.</p>
<h3 id="undo-bank">Undo Bank</h3>
<p><strong><code>U</code></strong> - Change the bank in memory back to the previously selected
bank. This command should be used in conjunction with the S command.</p>
<h3 id="x-modem-transfer">X-Modem Transfer</h3>
<p><strong><code>T xxxx</code></strong> - Receive an X-modem file transfer and load it into memory
starting at location xxxx.</p>
<p>128 byte blocks and checksum mode is the only supported protocol.</p>
<h3 id="exit-monitor">Exit Monitor</h3>
<p><strong><code>X</code></strong> - Exit the monitor program back to the main boot menu.</p>
<h2 id="romwbw-system-configuration">RomWBW System Configuration</h2>
<p>System Configuration (<code>SYSCONF</code>) is a utility that allows system
configuration to be set, dynamically and stored in NVRAM provided by an
RTC chip.</p>
<p>(<code>SYSCONF</code>) is both a ROM application (‘W’ Menu option), and a CP/M
utility. Noting however the CP/M utility is not included on an disk
image, it is found in the <code>Binary/Applications</code> folder of the RomWBW
distribution.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20User%20Guide.pdf">RomWBW User
Guide</a>
has additional information on the use of NVRAM to set your system
configuration.</p>
<h3 id="basic-operation">Basic Operation</h3>
<p>The application is an interactive application; it does not have a
command line syntax. Instead commands are executed from within the
application in a command line structure.</p>
<p>When you first start the (<code>SYSCONF</code>) utility it will display the current
switches followed by a command listing.</p>
<p>When you first run the (<code>SYSCONF</code>) utility the NVRAM will be
uninitialised, and can be initialised using the (R)eset command, which
writes default values to NVRAM.</p>
<p>Updates are done immediately to NVRAM as you enter them, i.e. there is
no confirm changes step. If you make any incorrect changes, you simply
need to enter a new command to set the Switch value correctly.</p>
<p>Once a change has been made it is available, however it may not take
effect until the next system reboot. This is dependent on the Switch
itself.</p>
<p>If no NVRAM is provided by your hardware, then running this application
will just report the missing hardware and exit immediately.</p>
<p>To exit from the application use the (Q)uit command.</p>

<h2 id="cpm-22">CP/M 2.2</h2>
<p>This option will boot the CP/M 2.2 disk operating system from an image
contained within the ROM. Please refer to the CPM User Manual in the
Doc/CPM folder of the distribution for CP/M usage. There are also many
online resources.</p>
<p>During the build process the system will create a ROM disk containing a
number of curated CP/M applications, and also a RAM drive. The capacity
of each will depend upon the size of the ROM and RAM available to the
system. A more complete set of utilities are provided within the disk
image files provided as part of RomWBW.</p>
<p>A number of the applications provided are generic to CP/M, while others
rely on particular hardware or aspects of RomWBW itself.</p>
<p>Those that are written specific to RomWBW include: ASSIGN, CPUSPD, FDU,
FORMAT, FLASH, FDISK80, MODE, REBOOT, RTC, SYSCOPY, TALK, TIMER, XM, and
COPYSL.</p>
<p>The CP/M utilities supplied with RomWBW warrant more detailed
descriptions, and so are described in some detail in their own section
of this user guide. In summary they provide the initial capability to
manage and update your RomWBW system, to create other bootable media
(hardware dependent) and to write/debug code using assembler and BASIC.</p>
<h2 id="z-system">Z-System</h2>
<p>Z-System is a complete alternative, but entirely compatible, disk
operating system to CP/M.</p>
<p>Z-System is comprised of ZSDOS 1.1 which is a replacement for CP/M’s
Basic Disk Operating System (BDOS), and ZCPR which is a replacement for
the Console Command Processor (CCP). Either or both may be used,
although using both together will allow ZCPR to make use of specific
ZSDOS features.</p>
<p>Documentation for Z-System may be found in the Doc/CPM folder of the
RomWBW distribution and the reader is referred to those.</p>
<h2 id="basic">BASIC</h2>
<p>For those who are not familiar with BASIC, it stands for Beginners All
Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code.</p>
<p>RomWBW contains two versions of ROM BASIC, a full implementation and a
“tiny” BASIC.</p>
<p>The full implementation is a version of Microsoft BASIC from the NASCOM
Computer.</p>
<p>A comprehensive instruction manual is available in the Doc/Contrib
directory.</p>

the Forth Interest Group website <a href="https://www.forth.org/">https://www.forth.org/</a>.</p>
<h3 id="important-things-to-know">Important things to know</h3>
<p>Forth is case sensitive.</p>
<p>To exit back to the boot loader type <strong><em>bye</em></strong></p>
<p>To get a list of available words type <strong><em>WORDS</em></strong></p>
<p>To reset Forth to its initial state type <strong><em>COLD</em></strong></p>
<p>Most of the code you find on the internet will not run unless modified
or additional Forth words are added to the dictionary.</p>
<p>This implementation does not support loading or saving of programs. All
programs need to be typed in. Additionally, screen editing and code
blocks are not supported.</p>
<p>A CP/M version is not provided with RomWBW, this is only a ROM
application. If you need to run it under CP/M you would need to download
it from the camelforth web site, the link is above.</p>

<h2 id="play-a-game">Play a Game</h2>
<h3 id="2048">2048</h3>
<p>2048 is a puzzle game that can be both mindless and challenging. It
appears deceptively simple but failure can creep up on you suddenly.</p>
<p>It requires an ANSI/VT-100 compatible colour terminal to play.</p>
<p>2048 is like a sliding puzzle game except the puzzle tiles are numbers
instead of pictures. Instead of moving a single tile all tiles are moved
simultaneously in the same direction. Where two tiles of the same number
collide, they are reduced to one tile with the combined value. After
every move a new tile is added with a starting value of 2.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a tile of 2048 before all tile locations are
occupied. Reaching the highest points score, which is the sum of all the
tiles is a secondary goal. The game will automatically end when there
are no more possible moves.</p>
<p>Play consists of entering a direction to move. Directions can be entered
using any of three different keyboard direction sets.</p>
<pre><code>Direction | Keys
----------|----------
Up        | w ^E 8
Down      | s ^X 2
Left      | a ^S 4
Right     | d ^D 6
</code></pre>
<p>The puzzle board is a 4x4 grid. At start, the grid will be populated
with two 2 tiles. An example game sequence is shown below with new tiles
to the game shown in brackets.</p>

<h2 id="network-boot">Network Boot</h2>
<p>If your RomWBW system is equipped with an RCBus MT011 module, it is
possible to boot into CP/M 2.2 directly from a CP/NET network server.
This means that the operating system will be loaded directly from the
network server and all of your drive letters will be provided by the
network server.</p>
<p>This function requires substantial knowledge of CP/NET and it’s
implementation within RomWBW. Section 10 of the <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20User%20Guide.pdf">RomWBW User
Guide</a>
provides complete instructions for setting up a CP/NET based network
under RomWBW including a section on network booting.</p>
<h2 id="xmodem-flash-updater">Xmodem Flash Updater</h2>
<p>The RomWBW Xmodem flash updater provides the capability to update RomWBW
from the boot loader using an x-modem file transfer. It offers similar
capabilities to Will Sowerbutts FLASH4 utility except that the flashing
process occurs during the file transfer.</p>
<p>These are the key differences between the two methods are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Xmodem Flash Updater</th>
<th>FLASH.COM (aka FLASH4)</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Available from the boot loader</td>
<td>Well proven and tested</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>.</td>
<td>Faster file transfer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The major disadvantages of the Updater is that it is new and relatively
untested. There is the risk that a failed transfer will result in a
partially flashed and unbootable ROM. There are some limitations on
serial transfer speeds.</p>
<p>The updater utility was initially intended to support the Retrobrew
SBC-V2-005 platform using Atmel 39SF040 flash chips but has now been
extended to be more generic in operation.</p>
<p>Supported flash chips are 39SF040, 29F040, AT49F040, AT29C040, M29F040 ,
MX29F040, A29010B, A29040B</p>
<p>The Atmel 39SF040 chip is recommended as it can erase and write 4Kb
sectors. Other chips require the whole chip to be erased.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>In most cases, completing a ROM update is a simple as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Booting to the boot loader prompt</li>
<li>Selecting option X - Xmodem Flash Updater</li>
<li>Selecting option U - Update</li>
<li>Initiating an X-modem transfer of your ROM image on your console
    device</li>
<li>Selecting option R - Reboot</li>
</ol>
<p>If your console device is not able to transfer a ROM image i.e. your
console is a VDU then you will have to use the console options to
identify which character-input/output device is to be used as the serial
device for transfer.</p>
<p>When your console is the serial device used for the transfer, no
progress information is displayed as this would disrupt the x-modem file
transfer. If you use an alternate character-input/output devices as the
serial device for the transfer then progress information will be
displayed on the console device.</p>
<p>Due to different platform processor speeds, serials speeds and flow
control capabilities the default console or serial device speed may need
to be reduced for a successful transfer and flash to occur. The <strong>Set
Console Interface/Baud code</strong> option at the Boot Loader can be used to
change the speed if required. Additionally, the Updater has options to
set to and revert from a recommended speed.</p>
<p>See the RomWBW Applications guide for additional information on
performing upgrades.</p>
<h3 id="console-options">Console Options</h3>
<p>Option ( C ) - Set Console Device</p>
<p>Option ( S ) - Set Serial Device</p>
<p>By default the updater assumes that the current console is a serial
device and that the ROM file to be flashed will also be transferred
across this device, so the Console and Serial device are both the same.</p>
<p>Either device can be can be change to another character-input/output
device but the updater will always expect to receive the x-modem
transfer on the <strong>Serial Device</strong></p>
<p>The advantage of transferring on a different device to the console is
that progress information can be displayed during the transfer.</p>
<p>Option ( &gt; ) - Set Recommended Baud Rate</p>
<p>Option ( \&lt; ) - Revert to Original Baud Rate</p>
<h3 id="programming-options">Programming options</h3>
<p>Option ( U ) - Begin Update</p>
<p>The will begin the update process. The updater will expect to start
receiving an x-modem file on the serial device unit.</p>
<p>X-modem sends the file in packets of 128 bytes. The updater will cache
32 packets which is 1 flash sector and then write that sector to the
flash device.</p>
<p>If using separate console, bank and sector progress information will
shown</p>
<pre><code>BANK 00 s00 s01 s02 s03 s04 s05 s06 s06 s07
BANK 01 s00 s01 s02 s03 s04 s05 s06 s06 s07
BANK 02 s00 s01 s02 s03 s04 s05 s06 s06 s07 etc
</code></pre>
<p>The x-modem file transfer protocol does not provide any filename or size
information for the transfer so the updater does not perform any checks
on the file suitability.</p>
<p>The updater expects the file size to be a multiple of 4 kilobytes and
will write all data received to the flash device. A system update file
(128kb .img) or complete ROM can be received and written (512kb or
1024kb .rom)</p>
<p>If the update fails it is recommended that you retry before rebooting or
exiting to the Boot loader as your machine may not be bootable.</p>
<p>Option ( D ) - Duplicate flash #1 to flash #2</p>
<p>This option will make a copy of flash #1 onto flash #2. The purpose of
this is to enable making a backup copy of the current flash. Intended
for systems using 2x512Kb Flash devices.</p>
<p>Option ( V ) - Toggle Write Verify</p>
<p>By default each flash sector will be verified after being written.
Slight performance improvements can be gained if turned off and could be
used if you are experiencing reliable transfers and flashing.</p>
<h3 id="exit-options">Exit options</h3>
<p>Option ( R ) - Reboot</p>
<p>Execute a cold reboot. This should be done after a successful update. If
you perform a cold reboot after a failed update then it is likely that
your system will be unusable and removing and reprogramming the flash
will be required.</p>
<p>Option ( Q ) - Quit to boot loader.</p>
<p>The SBC Boot Loader is reloaded from ROM and executed. After a
successful update a Reboot should be performed. However, in the case of
a failed update this option could be used to attempt to load CP/M and
perform the normal x-modem / flash process to recover.</p>
<h3 id="crc-utility-options">CRC Utility options</h3>
<p>Option ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) - Calculate and display CRC32 of 1st or 2nd 512k
ROM. Option ( 3 ) - Calculate and display CRC32 of a 1024k (2x512Kb)
ROM.</p>
<p>Can be used to verify if a ROM image has been transferred and flashed
correctly. Refer to the Tera Term section below for details on
configuring the automatic display of a files CRC after it has been
transferred.</p>
<p>In Windows, right clicking on a file should also give you a context menu
option CRC SHA which will allow you to select a CRC32 calculation to be
done on the selected file.</p>
<h3 id="tera-term-macro-configuration">Tera Term macro configuration</h3>
<p>Macros are a useful tool for automatic common tasks. There are a number
of instances where using macros to facilitate the update process could
be worthwhile if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the RomWBW development builds.</li>
<li>Doing lots of configuration changes.</li>
<li>Doing development on RomWBW drivers</li>
</ul>
<p>Macros can be used to automate sending ROM updates or images and for my
own purposed I have set up a separate macro for transferring each of the
standard build ROM, my own custom configuration ROM and update ROM.</p>
<p>An example macro file to send an *.upd file, using checksum mode and
display the crc32 value of the transmitted file:</p>
<pre><code>Xmodem send, checksum, display crc32
xmodemsend '\\desktop\users\phillip\documents\github\romwbw\binary\sbc_std_cust.upd' 1
crc32file crc '\\desktop\users\phillip\documents\github\romwbw\binary\sbc_std_cust.rom'
sprintf '0x%08x' crc
messagebox inputstr 'crc32'
</code></pre>
<h3 id="serial-speed-guidelines">Serial speed guidelines</h3>
<p>As identified in the introduction, there are limitations on serial speed
depending on processor speed and flow control settings. Listed below are

would be appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>All testing was done with Tera Term x-modem, Forcing checksum mode using
macros was found to give the most reliable transfer. Partial writes can
be completed with 39SF040 chips. Other chips require entire flash to be
erased before being written. An SBC V2-005 MegaFlash or Z80 MBC required
for 1mb flash support. The Updater assumes both chips are same type
Failure handling has not been tested. Timing broadly calibrated on a Z80
SBC-v2 Unabios not supported</p>
<h2 id="user-application">User Application</h2>
<p>RomWBW provides the facility for a user to build, include and execute
their own custom application directly from the applications menu at
boot-up. All that’s needed is for the user to create their custom code
ready for inclusion, recognising that there are certain constraints in
doing this.</p>
<p>In order to build properly, the build process requires that the file
<code>usrrom.asm</code> be found in the /Source/HBIOS folder of the RomWBW tree.</p>
<p>This source file needs to assemble using TASM and it must start at (ORG)
address 00100H as the RomWBW HBIOS reserves locations 00000H to 000FFH
for internal use. Further, the user application must assemble to a
maximum of <code>USR-SIZ</code> bytes.</p>
<p>During execution, the user application may make use of HBIOS calls as
necessary, and at exit it should return to the RomWBW boot loader using
the HBIOS warm reset. Note that no disk operating system (eg CP/M)
functions will be available as no disk operating system will have been
loaded.</p>
<p>There is a sample <code>usrrom.asm</code> supplied in Source/HBIOS and it is
recommended that, at least initially, users create their own application
based on this as a template because it already creates the necessary
variables, starts at (ORG) 00100H, and ensures that the assembled file
is padded to create a file <code>USR-SIZ</code> in length. Equally, should the the
user’s application prove too large for the space available then assembly
will be terminated with an error. Users should not remove this check
from the templated code.</p>
<p>If required, the user application may make use of the Z80 interrupt
system but if the user application wishes to rely on HBIOS functionality
then it must adhere to the HBIOS framework for managing interupts.
Alternatively, if the user appliction has no need for the HBIOS then it
may use its own custom code for handling interrupts. In that case, a
hard reset, rather than an HBIOS warm start, would be necessary to
return control to RomWBW.</p>
<h1 id="cpm-applications-rom-based-disk-based">CP/M Applications - ROM-Based &amp; Disk-Based</h1>
<p>There now follows a more detailed guide to using the small suite of
custom applications included with RomWBW. In general, these applications
are operating system agnostic – they run under any of the included
operating systems. However, they all require RomWBW – they are not
generic CP/M applications.</p>
<p>Most of the applications are custom written for RomWBW. However, some
are standard CP/M applications that have been adapted to run under
RomWBW (e.g. XM/XModem). The applications are generally matched to the
version of RomWBW they are distributed with. So, if you upgrade the
version of RomWBW in your system ROM, you will want to copy the
corresponding applications to any storage devices you are using.</p>
<p>Most of the applications are included on the RomWBW ROM disk, so they
are easy to access.</p>
<p>The applications are also included with all of the operating system disk
images provided with RomWBW. So, a simple way to ensure you have
matching applications is to write the disk images onto your disk media
when upgrading your ROM. Of course, this will destroy any existing data
on your disk media, so don’t do this if you are saving any data on the
media.</p>
<p>Most of the applications are included as source code in the RomWBW
distribution and are built during the normal build process. The source
code is found in the Source/Apps directory of the distribution. The
binary executable applications are found in the Binary/Apps directory.</p>
<p>The table below clarifies where each of the applications may be found.
It is not an exhaustive list, with further applications existing on both
the ROM-based and disk-based versions of CP/M. All of the Applications
included within RomWBW may be found within the Binary/Apps directory.</p>

<p>All of the CP/M applications may be found in the RomWBW Binary/Apps
directory and a user may copy those they need to their own customized
disk/slice.</p>
<p>Independently of whether the CP/M system was started from ROM or a boot
disk, such as a floppy disk or a slice on a CF or uSD memory card,
applications may be located on and executed from either the ROM-disk
itself or from other media. There are multiple disk images available for
CP/M (eg floppy, legacy hard-disk and new hard-disk formats) and they
all contain essentially the same set of applications.</p>
<p>There are particular advantages for each method of booting into CP/M.</p>
<p>ROM-based CP/M:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clean and reliable copy of CP/M with no possibility of corruption</li>
<li>No additional hardware required</li>
<li>Fast to boot</li>
<li>Rolled forward with new releases of RomWBW</li>
</ul>
<p>Disk-based CP/M:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater capacity allows for a larger number of applications</li>
<li>Allows for user-customisation of applications available</li>
<li>Allows individual disks to be tailored to a particular purpose, eg
  word processor</li>
</ul>
<p>For systems starting CP/M from a disk created from an image file, there
are a small number of additional applications stored in the <code>USER 2</code>
area of the disk. These applications do not form part of CP/M, but
rather are small utilities used for test purposes during develpment
work. They may, or may not, fuction correctly with any given hardware or
software configuration. Documentation for these untilities is very
limited, though the source files maybe found in the /Source folder. Note
that these utiltites are not available when starting CP/M from the ROM
image or from a floppy disk.</p>
<p>A number of the CP/M applications available are described in more detail
in the following sections, each with an indication as to whether that
application may be found on the ROM-disk, a boot-disk, or both.</p>

<p>RomWBW includes a flexible mechanism for associating the operating
system drive letters (A: - P:) to the physical devices in the system.
Drive letter assignments can be changed on a running operating system
without rebooting. The ASSIGN command facilitates this by allowing you
to display, assign, reassign, or remove the drive letter assignments.</p>
<h4 id="syntax">Syntax</h4>
<p><code>ASSIGN /?</code><br />
<code>ASSIGN /L</code><br />
<code>ASSIGN</code> <em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em><code>=</code><br />
<code>ASSIGN</code><br />
<code>ASSIGN [</code><em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em><code>],...</code><br />
<code>ASSIGN</code> <em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em><code>=[</code><em><code>&lt;device&gt;</code></em><code>:[</code><em><code>&lt;slice&gt;</code></em><code>]],...</code><br />
<code>ASSIGN</code> <em><code>&lt;tgtdrv&gt;</code></em><code>=</code><em><code>&lt;srcdrv&gt;</code></em><code>,...</code><br />
<code>ASSIGN /B='*'&lt;option&gt;'*'['*'&lt;option&gt;'*'['*'&lt;option&gt;'*'...]]</code></p>
<h4 id="usage_1">Usage</h4>
<p><code>ASSIGN /?</code> will display brief command usage and version information.</p>
<p><code>ASSIGN /L</code> will display a list of all the devices available to be used
in drive assignments in the running system. The devices listed may or
may not contain media. Although some device types support the use of
slices, the list does not indicate this.</p>
<p><code>ASSIGN A:</code> just specifying the drive letter will display the assignment
for the drive letter</p>
<p><code>ASSIGN</code> with no parameters will list all of the current drive
assignments.</p>
<h4 id="usage-specific">Usage (Specific)</h4>
<p>The following describes how to assign drive specifically by identifing
each drive by its unique device and slice id’s</p>
<p><code>ASSIGN</code> <em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em> will display the assignment for the specific drive
For example, <code>ASSIGN C:</code> will display the assignment for drive C:.</p>
<p><code>ASSIGN</code> <em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em><code>=</code><em><code>&lt;device&gt;</code></em><code>[:</code><em><code>&lt;slice&gt;</code></em><code>]</code> will assign (or
reassign) a drive letter to a new device and (optionally) slice. If no
slice is specified, then slice 0 is assumed. For example,
<code>ASSIGN C:=IDE0</code> will assign drive letter C: to device IDE0, slice 0.
<code>ASSIGN D:=IDE0:3</code> will assign drive letter D: to device IDE0 slice 3.</p>
<p>The <code>ASSIGN</code> command will not allow you to specify a slice (other than
zero) for devices that do not support slices. A slice should only be
specified for hard disk devices (SD, IDE, PPIDE). Floppy disk drives and
RAM/ROM drives do not have slices.</p>
<p><code>ASSIGN</code> <em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em><code>=</code> can be used to remove the assignment from a drive
letter. So, <code>ASSIGN E:=</code> will remove the association of drive letter E:
from any previous device.</p>
<p><code>ASSIGN</code> <em><code>&lt;tgtdrv&gt;</code></em><code>=</code><em><code>&lt;srcdrv&gt;</code></em> is used to swap the assignments of
two drive letters. For example, <code>ASSIGN C:=D:</code> will swap the device
assignments of C: and D:.</p>
<p>The <code>ASSIGN</code> command supports “stacking” of instructions. For example,
<code>ASSIGN C:=IDE0:0,D:=IDE0:1,E:=</code> will assign C: and D: to the first two
slices of IDE 0 and will unassign E:.</p>
<p>When the command runs it will echo the resultant assignments to the
console to confirm its actions. It will also display the remaining space
available in disk buffers.</p>
<h4 id="usage-bulk">Usage (Bulk)</h4>
<p>The following describes how to assign drives in bulk without having to
specify the identifiers of each drive being mapped. Instead bulk mode
has a predefined set options (identified by single letter) which will
map drives. Bulk mode works by assigning drives sequentially starting at
A: until all drives are used, or there are no more options to process.
Each option will typically map between 0 and N drives depending on the
option and the available hardware in your system.</p>
<p><code>ASSIGN /B=</code><em><code>&lt;option&gt;&lt;option&gt;</code></em>… will perform bulk assignment .</p>
<p>The following options will assign a small number of devices, typically
you would place at beginning of an option list.</p>

<p>A drive e.g. RAM, ROM, FLOPPY can only be assigned if it exists. if you
system doesn’t have the hardware that supports the device, then no
devices will be assigned, and the next option will be processed.</p>
<p><code>B</code> assigns the boot device. If used the <code>B</code>oot drive should typically
be assigned first.</p>
<p><code>P</code> will not make any changes to the next drive, it will skip over it.
While the <code>X</code> option will un-assign the next drive, leaving a gap.</p>
<p>The remaining options will fill drives mostly to end, from hard drive
slices, generally choose 1 of the following:</p>

<p><code>S</code>lices assignment will map all remaining drives to slices from the
boot device. If I have other hard drives present these will not be
mapped by this option.</p>
<p>e.g. <code>ASSIGN /B=BAOS</code></p>
<p>Will first assign drives <code>A:(Boot), B:(RAM), C:(ROM)</code> this leaves 13
drives which will be assigned to slices from the boot hard drive (D:
thru P:), leaving no unused drives.</p>
<p>’H’ard drive assignment will attempt to fill all remaining drive letters
by splitting the number of drives remaining evenly across all.</p>
<p>e.g. <code>ASSIGN /B=BAOH</code></p>
<p>Will first assign drives <code>A:(Boot), B:(RAM), C:(ROM)</code> this leaves 13
drives available. If I have 3 hard disks then (13/3) = 4 slices from
each hard drive will be assigned to drives (D: thru O:), leaving a
single unused drive (P:).</p>
<p><code>L</code>egacy hard drive assignment is identical to how the startup hard disk
assignment works. ie. Attempt to assign up to 8 hard drives split across
hard drives detected at boot.</p>
<p>e.g. <code>ASSIGN /B=BAOL</code></p>
<p>Will first assign drives <code>A:(Boot), B:(RAM), C:(ROM)</code>. If I have 3 hard
disks then (8/3) = 2 slices from each hard drive will be assigned to
drives (D: thru I:), leaving 7 unused drives (J: thru P:).</p>
<h4 id="notes_1">Notes</h4>
<p>If the <code>ASSIGN</code> command encounters any rule violations or errors, it
will abort with an error and <strong>none</strong> of the drive assignments will be
implemented. In other words, the command is atomic and will either
completely succeed or completely fail.</p>
<p>All assigned drives utilize disk buffer space from a limited pool. The
ASSIGN command will display the amount of buffer space remaining after
an assign command is executed. Buffer space is freed if a drive is
unassigned. If the total assignments exceed the available disk buffer
space available, the command will abort with an error message.</p>
<p>The <code>ASSIGN</code> command does not check to see if the device and slice being
assigned actually contains readable media. If the assigned device has no
media, you will receive an I/O error when you attempt to use the drive
letter.</p>
<p>The <code>ASSIGN</code> command does not check that the media is large enough to
support the slice you specify. In other words, you could potentially
assign a drive letter to a slice that is beyond the end of the media in
a device. In this case, subsequent attempts to use that drive letter
will result in an I/O error.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>ASSIGN</code> command does not check to see if the slice
specified refers to an area on your media that is occupied by other data
(such as a FAT filesystem).</p>
<p>You will not be allowed to assign multiple drive letters to a single
device and slice. In other words, only one drive letter may refer to a
single filesystem at a time.</p>
<p>Attempts to assign a duplicate drive letter will fail and display an
error. If you wish to assign a different drive letter to a
device/unit/slice, unassign the existing drive letter first.</p>
<p>Drive letter A: must always be assigned to a device and slice. The
<code>ASSIGN</code> command will enforce this.</p>
<p>The changes made by this command are not permanent. The assignments will
persist through a warm start, but when you reboot your system, all drive
letters will return to their default assignments. A SUBMIT batch file
can be used to setup desired drive assignments automatically at boot.</p>
<p>Be aware that this command will allow you to reassign or remove the
assignment of your system drive letter. This can cause your operating
system to fail and force you to reboot.</p>
<p>The <code>ASSIGN</code> command does <strong>not</strong> prevent you from assigning a drive
letter to a slice that does not fit on the physical media. However, any
subsequent attempt to refer to that drive letter will result in an
immediate OS error of “no disk”. Refer to “Hard Disk Capacity” in the
<a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20User%20Guide.pdf">RomWBW User
Guide</a>
for a discussion of the exact number of slices that will fit on a
specific physical disk size.</p>
<p>This command is particularly sensitive to being matched to the
appropriate version of the RomWBW ROM you are using. Be very careful to
keep all copies of <code>ASSIGN.COM</code> up to date with your ROM.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>ASSIGN</code> command must be able to adjust to CP/M 2.2
vs. CP/M 3. If you utilize an RSX that modifies the BDOS version
returned, you are likely to have serious problems. In this case, be sure
to use <code>ASSIGN</code> prior to loading the RSX or after it is unloaded.</p>

<h4 id="notes_2">Notes</h4>
<p>The cursor and screen management assumes the use of an ANSI/VT-100
terminal which is generally correct for RomWBW. Support for a hardware
system timer is also implemented. If your system does not have a
hardware timer, the TIME function will always return 0 and the timeout
parameter of the INKEY(n) function will not be observed (will never
timeout).</p>

<h4 id="syntax_2">Syntax</h4>
<p><code>CLRDIR</code><em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em></p>
<h4 id="usage_3">Usage</h4>
<p><code>CLRDIR</code><em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em> will initialise the directory area of the specified
drive. The drive may take any form - eg floppy disk, hard-disk, CF, uSD
etc.</p>
<p>The use of FDISK80 to reserve space, or slices, for CP/M use as drives
will not initialise the directory areas of those slices. The resultant
directory areas will contain garbage left over from a previous use of
the disk (or media) and using them in this state with CP/M will very
likely lead to failed or corrupted data storage. Use <code>CLRDIR</code> to
initialise the directory properly.</p>
<p>FDU will initialise the directory of a floppy disk as part of the
formatting process and so <code>CLRDIR</code> is unnecessary for a floppy disk.
<code>CLRDIR</code> is, therefore, primarily used with other types such as
hard-disk, CF and uSD.</p>
<p>The <code>CLRDIR</code> command may also be used to effectively ‘reformat’ a used
disk by reinitialising its directory area and effectively making it
blank again.</p>
<p>Use <code>CLRDIR</code> with caution as changes made to disks by <code>CLRDIR</code> cannot be
undone.</p>
<h4 id="notes_3">Notes</h4>
<p>If <code>CLRDIR</code> is used on disk containing data then the directory area will
be reinitialised and the data previously stored will be lost.</p>

<p>The <code>CPUSPD</code> application is used to change the running speed and wait

<p>Entering <code>CPUSPD</code> with no parameters will display the current CPU speed
and wait state information of the running system. Wait state information
is not available for all systems.</p>
<p>To modify the running speed of a system, you can specify the
<code>*</code><speed><code>*</code> parameter. To modify either or both of the wait states,
you can enter the desired number. Either or both of the wait state
parameters may be omitted and the current wait state settings will
remain in effect.</p>
<h4 id="notes_4">Notes</h4>
<p>The ability to modify the running speed and wait states of a system
varies widely depending on the hardware capabilities and the HBIOS
configuration settings.</p>
<p>Note that it is frequently impossible to tell if a system is capable of
dynamic speed changes. This function makes the changes blindly. If an
attempt is made to change the speed of a system that is definitely
incapable of doing so, then an error result is returned.</p>

<p>SBC and MBC systems may be able to change their CPU speed if the
hardware supports it and it is enabled in the HBIOS configuration.</p>
<p>The <code>CPUSPD</code> command makes no attempt to ensure that the new CPU speed
will actually work on the current hardware. Setting a CPU speed that
exceeds the capabilities of the system will result in unstable operation
or a system stall.</p>
<p>In the case of Z180 CPUs, it is frequently necessary to add memory wait
states when increasing the CPU speed.</p>
<p>Some peripherals are dependent on the CPU speed. For example, the Z180
ASCI baud rate and system timer are derived from the CPU speed. The
CPUSPD application will attempt to adjust these peripherals for correct
operation after modifying the CPU speed. However, in some cases this may
not be possible. The baud rate of ASCI ports have a limited set of
divisors. If there is no satisfactory divisor to retain the existing
baud rate under the new CPU speed, then the baud rate of the ASCI
port(s) will be affected.</p>
<h4 id="etymology_2">Etymology</h4>
<p>The <code>CPUSPD</code> application was custom written for RomWBW. All of the

<p>The purpose of this utility is to allow the copying of whole disk slices
from one disk slice to another slice</p>
<p>This tool is only supported by RomWBW HBIOS, it uses HDIOS for all its
disk IO. UNA UBIOS is not supported by this tool.</p>
<p>This tool is running on CP/M 2.2 or 3.0 and has access to full 64kb of
RAM, with a minimum of 48kb TPA</p>
<p>This tool only works with hard disk devices, other media types like
floppy, are not supported at this time. This tool works across different
hard disk device types, even of different physical type</p>
<p>Both hd1k and hd512 are fully supported, however copying from one layout
type to the other is not supported.</p>
<p>During operation data is copied in a single read/write pass, data is not
verified by default. If there is a write error, it will be reported, and
operation will stop.</p>
<h4 id="syntax_4">Syntax</h4>
<p>This tool operates at the disk level via RomWBW, thus all disk
identifiers are in the RomWBW \&lt;disk&gt;.\&lt;unit&gt; format.</p>
<p>The syntax (similar to copy) for the command is:</p>
<p><code>COPYSL</code><em>\&lt;destunit&gt;</em>[<code>.</code><em>\&lt;slice&gt;</em>]<code>=</code><em>\&lt;srcunit&gt;</em>[<code>.</code><em>\&lt;slice&gt;</em>]
[<code>/</code><em>\&lt;options&gt;</em>]</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>COPYSL 3.3=2.10 /U</p>
<p>Means copy from slice 10 on disk 2, onto disk 3 slice 3. This is in
unattended mode, so you will not be asked to confirm the copy operation.</p>
<h4 id="options">Options</h4>
<p>F - Full disk copy. Copies the complete disk slice, all sectors.<br />
U - Unattended. Will complete copy without confirmation from the user.<br />
V - Verify. Does an additional read and verify after write.</p>
<h4 id="usage_5">Usage</h4>
<p>When run COPYSL will perform command line argument validation and
display an error if they are illegal. Also any disk IO errors will cause
COPYSL to exit.</p>
<p>When specifying slice number(s) a check is made that the slice number is
valid, i.e. not too large that it would extend past the end of the
partition (hd1k), or the end of the media (hd512). For hd512 a check is
also performed to ensure that the slice would not extend into the first
defined partition.</p>
<p>The copy operation will be faster if the source disk has been formatted
with the CP/M file system, since during copy the CP/M directory is
scanned, and unused blocks are not copied.</p>
<p>If a filesystem is not found, (or the /F option is chosen) all data is
copied.</p>
<p>Verification (if option chosen) will do an aditional read (after write)
and compare the data read matches what was written. This compare is only
on every 32’nd byte. This is done for efficiency.</p>
<p>During copy dots “.” will be displayed to indicate progress of the copy.
Each “.” represents 16 kBytes of data. Each line of “.” ’s is 1 mBytes.</p>
<h4 id="notes_5">Notes</h4>
<p>This tool has been tested on both SD and CF media types and with hd1k
and hd512 formatted media.</p>
<p>You cannot copy slices between different hard disk formats (hd512 and
hd1k) because the slices are incompatible.</p>

<p>The operating systems included with RomWBW do not have any native
ability to access MS-DOS FAT filesystems. The FAT application can be
used overcome this. It will allow you to transfer files between CP/M and
FAT filesystems (wildcards supported). It can also erase files, format,
and list directories of FAT filesystems.</p>

<em><code>&lt;from&gt;</code></em>, <em><code>&lt;to&gt;</code></em> are FAT filenames<br />
<em><code>&lt;file&gt;</code></em> is a FAT filename<br />
<em><code>&lt;dir&gt;</code></em> is a FAT directory name<br />
<em><code>&lt;drv&gt;</code></em> is a RomWBW disk unit number</p>
<p>CP/M filespec: <em><code>&lt;d&gt;</code></em><code>:FILENAME.EXT</code> (<em><code>&lt;d&gt;</code></em> is CP/M drive letter
A-P)<br />
FAT filespec: <em><code>&lt;u&gt;</code></em><code>:/DIR/FILENAME.EXT</code> (<em><code>&lt;u&gt;</code></em> is RomWBW disk unit
#)</p>
<h4 id="usage_6">Usage</h4>
<p>The <code>FAT</code> application determines whether you are referring to a CP/M
filesystem or a FAT filesystem based on the way you specify the file or
path. If the file or path is prefixed with a number (n:), then it is
assumed this is a FAT filesystem reference and is referring to the FAT
filesystem on RomWBW disk unit ‘n’. Otherwise, the file specification is
assumed to be a normal CP/M file specification.</p>
<p>If you wanted to list the directory of the FAT filesystem on RomWBW disk
unit 2, you would use <code>FAT DIR 2:</code>. If you only wanted to see the “.TXT”
files, you would use <code>FAT DIR 2:*.TXT</code>.</p>
<p>If you wanted to copy all of the files on CP/M drive B: to the FAT
filesystem on RomWBW disk unit 4, you would use the command
<code>FAT COPY B:*.* 4:</code> If you wanted to copy the files to the “FOO”
directory, then you would use <code>FAT COPY B:*.* 4:\FOO</code>. To copy files in
the opposite direction, you just reverse the parameters.</p>
<p>To rename the file “XXX.DAT” to “YYY.DAT” on a FAT filesystem, you could
use a command like “FAT REN 2:XXX.DAT 2:YYY.DAT”.</p>
<p>To delete a file “XXX.DAT” on a FAT filesystem in directory “FOO”, you
would use a command like <code>FAT DEL 2:\FOO\XXX.DAT</code>.</p>
<p>To make a directory called “FOO2” on a FAT filesystem, you would use a
command line <code>FAT MD 2:\FOO2</code>.</p>
<p>To format the filesystem on a FAT partition, you would use a command
like <code>FAT FORMAT 2:</code>. Use this with caution because it will destroy all
data on any pre-existing FAT filesystem on disk unit 2.</p>
<h4 id="notes_6">Notes</h4>
<p>Partitioned or non-partitioned media is handled automatically. A floppy
drive is a good example of a non-partitioned FAT filesystem and will be
recognized. Larger media will typically have a partition table which
will be recognized by the application to find the FAT filesystem.</p>
<p>Although RomWBW-style CP/M media does not know anything about partition
tables, it is entirely possible to have media that has both CP/M and FAT
file systems on it. This is accomplished by creating a FAT filesystem on
the media that starts on a track beyond the last track used by CP/M.
Each CP/M slice can occupy up to 8MB. So, make sure to start your FAT
partition beyond (slice count) * 9MB.</p>
<p>The application infers whether you are attempting to reference a FAT or
CP/M filesystem via the drive specifier (char before ‘:’). A numeric
drive character specifies the HBIOS disk unit number for FAT access. An
alpha (A-P) character indicates a CP/M file system access targeting the
specified drive letter. If there is no drive character specified, the
current CP/M filesystem and current CP/M drive is assumed. For example:</p>
<p><code>2:README.TXT</code> refers to FAT file “README.TXT” on disk unit #2<br />
<code>C:README.TXT</code> refers to CP/M file “README.TXT” on CP/M drive C<br />
<code>README.TXT</code> refers to CP/M file “README.TXT” on the current CP/M drive</p>
<p>Files with SYS, HIDDEN, or R/O only attributes are not given any special
treatment. Such files are found and processed like any other file.
However, any attempt to write to a read-only file will fail and the
application will abort.</p>
<p>It is not currently possible to reference CP/M user areas other than the
current user. To copy files to alternate user areas, you must switch to
the desired user number first or use an additional step to copy the file
to the desired user area.</p>
<p>Accessing FAT filesystems on a floppy requires the use of RomWBW HBIOS
v2.9.1-pre.13 or greater.</p>
<p>Only the first 8 RomWBW disk units (0-7) can be referenced.</p>
<p>Files written are not verified.</p>
<p>Wildcard matching in FAT filesystems is a bit unusual as implemented by
FatFs. See FatFs documentation.</p>
<h4 id="etymology_4">Etymology</h4>
<p>The <code>FAT</code> application is an original RomWBW work, but utilizes the FsFat
library for all of the FAT filesystem work. This application is written
in C and requires SDCC to compile. As such it is not part of the RomWBW
build process. However, the full project and source code is found in the
<a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/FAT">FAT GitHub Repository</a>.</p>
<h4 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h4>
<p>CP/M (and workalike) OSes have significant restrictions on filename
characters. The FAT application will block any attempt to create a file
on the CP/M filesystem containing any of these prohibited characters:</p>
<p><code>&lt; &gt; . , ; : ? * [ ] |/ \</code></p>
<p>The operation will be aborted with “<code>Error: Invalid Path Name</code>” if such
a filename character is encountered.</p>
<p>Since MS-DOS does allow some of these characters, you can have issues
when copying files from MS-DOS to CP/M if the MS-DOS filenames use these
characters. Unfortunately, FAT is not yet smart enough to substitute
illegal characters with legal ones. So, you will need to clean the
filenames before trying to copy them to CP/M.</p>
<p>The FAT application does try to detect the scenario where you are
copying a file to itself. However, this detection is not perfect and can
corrupt a file if it occurs. Be careful to avoid this.</p>

disk partitions.</p>
<p>This application is provided by John Coffman. The primary documentation
is in the file “FDisk Manual.pdf” found in the Doc directory of the
RomWBW distribution.</p>
<h4 id="usage_7">Usage</h4>
<p><code>FDISK80</code> is an interactive application. At startup it will ask you for
the disk unit that you want to partition. When your RomWBW system boots,
it will display a table with the disk unit numbers. Use the disk unit
numbers from that table to enter the desired disk unit to partition.</p>
<p><code>FDISK80</code> operates very much like other FDISK disk partitioning
applications. Please refer to the file called “FDisk Manual.pdf” in the
Doc directory of the RomWBW distribution for further instructions.</p>
<p>If ‘slices’ for CP/M have been created using <code>FDISK80</code>, then these will
need to have their directory areas initialised properly using <code>CLRDIR</code>.
Failure to do this will likely result in corrupted data.</p>

<h4 id="notes_7">Notes</h4>
<p>Hard disk partition tables allow a maximum of 1024 cylinders when
defining partitions. However, RomWBW uses exclusively Logical Block
Addressing (LBA) which does not have this limitation. When defining
partitions is usually best to define the start and size of of the
partition using bytes or sectors.</p>

it, and verify it.</p>
<p>You can use the <code>FLASH READ</code> form of the command to read the ROM image
from your system into a file. This is useful if you want to save a copy
of your current ROM before reprogramming it.</p>
<p>Although <code>FLASH WRITE</code> automatically performs a verification, you can
manually perform a verification function with the <code>FLASH VERIFY</code> form of
the command.</p>
<p>The author’s documentation for the application is found in the RomWBW

<h4 id="notes_9">Notes</h4>
<p>The application supports a significant number of EEPROM parts. It should
automatically detect your part. If it does not recognize your chip, make
sure that you do not have a write protect jumper set – this jumper can
prevent the ROM chip from being recognized.</p>
<p>Reprogramming a ROM chip in-place is inherently dangerous. If anything
goes wrong, you will be left with a non-functional system and no ability

dynamically.</p>
<h4 id="syntax_10">Syntax</h4>
<p><code>MODE /?</code>
<code>MODE COM</code><em><code>&lt;n&gt;</code></em><code>: [</code><em><code>&lt;baud&gt;</code></em><code>[,</code><em><code>&lt;parity&gt;</code></em><code>[,</code><em><code>&lt;databits&gt;</code></em><code>[,</code><em><code>&lt;stopbits&gt;</code></em><code>]]]] [/P]</code></p>
<p><code>/?</code> displays command usage and version information</p>
<p><em><code>&lt;n&gt;</code></em> is the character device unit number</p>
<p><em><code>&lt;baud&gt;</code></em> is numerical baudrate</p>
<p><em><code>&lt;parity&gt;</code></em> is (N)one, (O)dd, (E)ven, (M)ark, or (S)pace</p>
<p><em><code>&lt;databits&gt;</code></em> is number of data bits, typically 7 or 8</p>
<p><em><code>&lt;stopbits&gt;</code></em> is number of stop bits, typically 1 or 2</p>
<p><code>/P</code> prompts user prior to setting new configuration</p>
<h4 id="usage_11">Usage</h4>
<p><code>MODE /?</code> will display basic command usage and version information.</p>
<p><code>MODE</code> with no parameters will list all devices and their current
configuration.</p>
<p><code>MODE &lt;</code><em>n</em><code>&gt;</code> will display the current configuration of the specified
character device unit.</p>
<p><code>MODE COM</code><em><code>&lt;n&gt;</code></em><code>: [</code><em><code>&lt;baud&gt;</code></em><code>[,</code><em><code>&lt;parity&gt;</code></em><code>[,</code><em><code>&lt;databits&gt;</code></em><code>[,</code>

set on the character device unit. You can use commas with no values to
leave some values unchanged. As an example, <code>MODE COM0: 9600,,,2</code> will
setup character device unit 0 for 9600 baud and 2 stop bits while
leaving data bits and stop bits as is.</p>
<p>Appending <code>/P</code> in a command specifying a new configuration will cause
the terminal output to pause and wait for the user to press a key. This
allows the user to change the local terminal setup before continuing.</p>
<h4 id="notes_12">Notes</h4>
<p>Specified baud rate and line characteristics must be supported by the
serial unit. Any parameters not specified will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Changes are not persisted and will revert to system defaults at next
system boot.</p>
<p>Not all character devices support all <code>MODE</code> options. Some devices
(notably ASCI devices) have limited baud rate divisors. An attempt to
set a baud rate that the device cannot support will fail with an error
message.</p>

<p>To make disk media bootable, you must write a system boot image onto the

tracks of drive C: and store it in the file A:OS.SYS.</p>
<p><code>SYSCOPY D:=C:</code> will copy the system tracks from drive C: onto the
system tracks of drive D:.</p>
<h4 id="notes_17">Notes</h4>
<p>The RomWBW ROM disk contains files with the system boot image for
Z-System and CP/M 2.2. These files are called CPM.SYS and ZSYS.SYS
respectively. These files can be used as the source of a <code>SYSCOPY</code>
command to make a disk bootable with the corresponding operating system.</p>
<p>CP/M 3 uses a two phase boot process. To make a CP/M 3 drive bootable,
you need to put “CPMLDR.SYS” on the boot tracks of the disk and be sure
that the drive also contains the “CPM.SYS” file. The “CPMLDR.SYS” file
is not included on the ROM disk, but is found on the CP/M 3 disk image.</p>
<p>ZPM3 is similar to CP/M 3. You also put “CPMLDR.SYS” on the system
tracks of the drive to make it bootable. The ZPM3 operating system is in
the file called “CPM3.SYS” on the ZPM3 disk image. It may seem confusing
that ZPM3 is in the file called CPM3.SYS, but it is normal for ZPM3.</p>
<p>For the purposes of booting an operating system, each disk slice is
considered its own operating system. Each slice can be made bootable
with its own system tracks.</p>
<p><code>SYSCOPY</code> uses drive letters to specify where to read/write the system
boot images. However, at startup, the boot loaded will require you to
enter the actual disk device and slice to boot from. So, you need to be
careful to pay attention to the device and slice that is assigned to a
drive letter so you will know what to enter at the boot loader prompt.
By way of explanation, the boot loader does not know about drive letters
because the operating system is not loaded yet.</p>
<p>If you want to put a boot system image on a device and slice that is not
currently assigned to a drive letter, you will need to assign a drive
letter first.</p>
<p>Not all disk formats include space for system tracks. Such disk formats
cannot contains a system boot image and, therefore, cannot be made
bootable. The best example of such disk formats are the ROM and RAM
disks. To maximize usable file space on these drives, they do not have
system tracks. Obviously, ROM operating system is supported by choosing
a ROM operating system at the boot loader prompt. Any attempt to write a
system boot image to disk media with no system tracks will cause SYSCOPY
to fail with an error message.</p>
<p>The system boot images are paired with the ROM version in your system.
So, you must take care to update the system tracks of any bootable disk
when you upgrade your ROM firmware.</p>
<p>The system boot images are <strong>not</strong> tied to specific hardware
configurations. System boot images and operating systems provided with
RomWBW will work with any supported RomWBW platform or hardware as long
as they are the same version as the RomWBW firmware.</p>

<p>The +t and -t options apply only to HBIOS mode operation. The <code>-MSX</code>,
<code>-RC</code>, and <code>--HBIOS</code> options are mutually exclusive. See Notes below.</p>
<h4 id="usage_20">Usage</h4>
<p>The TUNE application supports PT and YM sound file formats. It
determines the format of the file from the extension of the file, so
your tune filenames should end in .PT2, .PT3, or .MYM.</p>
<p>To play a sound file, just use the command and specify the file to play
after the command. So, for example, <code>TUNE ATTACK.PT2</code> will immediately
begin playing the PT sound file “ATTACK.PT2”.</p>
<h4 id="notes_21">Notes</h4>
<p>The <code>TUNE</code> application automatically probes for compatible hardware at
well known port addresses at startup. It will auto-configure itself for
the hardware found. If no hardware is detected, it will abort with an
error message.</p>
<p>Some hardware (notably Why-Em-Ulator) cannot be detected due limitations
of the emulation. In such cases, you can force the use of the two most
common port addresses using the <code>-MSX</code> or <code>-RC</code> options.</p>
<p>On Z180 systems, I/O wait states are added when writing to the sound
chip to avoid exceeding its speed limitations. On Z80 systems, you will
need to ensure that the CPU clock speed of your system does not exceed
the timing limitations of your sound chip.</p>
<p>The application probes for an active system timer and uses it to
accurately pace the sound file playback. If no system timer is
available, a delay loop is calculated instead. The delay loop will not
be as accurate as the system timer. If the <code>-DELAY</code> options is specified
on the command line, then the delay loop will be used regardless of
whether the system has a hardware timer. This is useful if the hardware
timer does not run at the 50Hz desired for sound playback.</p>
<p>There are two modes of operation. A direct hardware interface for the
AY-3-8910 or YM2149 chips, or a compatibility layer thru HBIOS
supporting both the AY-3-8910 and the SN76489 chip.</p>
<p>By default the application will attempt to interface directly to the
sound chip. The optional argument <code>--HBIOS</code> supplied after the filename,
will enable the application to use the HBIOS sound driver.</p>
<p>The following summarizes the different modes of operation for the
application:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you use <code>TUNE</code> with no options, it will use it’s original behavior
  of searching for and detecting a sound chip. <code>TUNE</code> will play sound
  files directly to the PSG hardware. In this mode it does not matter if
  HBIOS does or does not know about the sound chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use <code>TUNE</code> with the <code>--HBIOS</code> option, it will not detect a
  sound chip and will use the RomWBW HBIOS interface. This will only
  work if HBIOS was configured for the installed sound card and HBIOS
  detects the sound chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use <code>TUNE</code> with <code>-RC</code> or <code>-MSX</code>, it will play tunes directly to
  the PSG hardware (not via HBIOS) and will bypass detection. In this
  mode it does not matter if HBIOS does or does not know about the sound
  chip.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the HBIOS API for sound cards is pretty good, but does not
implement everything that the sound card can do. For best fidelity, use
<code>TUNE</code> without the <code>--HBIOS</code> option.</p>
<p>All RomWBW operating system boot disks include a selection of sound
files in user area 3.</p>
<h4 id="etymology_18">Etymology</h4>

<p>This application will allow you to play Video Game Music files. VGM
files contain music samples from a range of different sound chips that
were used in arcade games, game consoles and personal computer systems.</p>
<p>Video Game Music files have a .VGM file extension and each file contains
an embedded header that identifies the hardware it is intended for and
also the title of the music.</p>
<p>All RomWBW operating system boot disks include a selection of sound
files in user area 3. Additional music files can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="https://vgmrips.net">VGMRIPS website</a></p>
<p><a href="https://project2612.org/">PROJECT2612 website</a></p>
<p>Sound files are loaded into memory for playback, so the maximum size
file that can be played is around 52Kb.</p>
<p>Sound chips currently supported are:</p>
<ul>
<li>AY-3-8190 (and equivalent YM2149)</li>
<li>YM2612 (and equivalent YM3848)</li>
<li>SN76489 (single chip mono and dual chip stereo)</li>
<li>YM2151</li>
</ul>
<p>VGMPLAY supports playback of files with multiple combinations of these
chips.</p>
<h4 id="syntax_20">Syntax</h4>
<p><code>VGMPLAY</code><em><code>&lt;filename&gt;</code></em></p>
<p><em><code>&lt;filename&gt;</code></em> is the name of a sound file ending in .VGM</p>
<h4 id="usage_21">Usage</h4>
<p>VGMPLAY does not automatically detect the hardware platform or sound
hardware that you are using. This means a version customized for your
system must be assembled before use. However, the version as distributed
will work with ECB bus SBC systems.</p>
<p>To play a sound file, just use the VGMPLAY command and specify the file
to play after the command. So, for example, <code>VGMPLAY TEDDY</code> will load
the TEDDY.VGM sound file into memory and begin playing it.</p>
<p>Playback can be stopped by pressing a key. There may be a delay before
playback stops.</p>
<h4 id="notes_22">Notes</h4>
<p>The default build configuration for VGMPLAY is:</p>
<p>CPU speed: Autodetected</p>

<p>Inconsistant, garbled or distorted playback can be an indication that
your CPU clock speed is too high for your sound chip. In this case, if
your platform supports speed switching, then the CPUSPD application can
be used to reduce your processor speed.</p>
<p>VGMPLAY is still under development. The source code is provided in the
RomWBW distribution.</p>

<p><code>wdate</code> is a utility for CP/M systems that have Wayne Warthen’s RomWBW
firmware. It reads or sets the real-time clock, using function calls in
the BIOS. It should work on any RTC device that is supported by RomWBW,
including the internal interrupt-driven timer that is is available on
some systems.</p>
<p><code>wdate</code> differs from the <code>rtc.com</code> utility that is provided with the
RomWBW version of CP/M in that it only gets and sets the date/time.
<code>rtc.com</code> can also manipulate the nonvolatile RAM in certain clock
devices, and modify the charge controller. However, <code>wdate</code> is (I would
argue) easier to use, as it takes its input from the command line, which
can be edited, and it’s less fussy about the format. It doesn’t require
the date to be set if you only want to change the time, for example. In
addition, <code>wdate</code> has at least some error checking.</p>
<p><code>wdate</code> displays the day-of-week and month as English text, not numbers.
It calculates the day-of-week from the year, month, and day. RTC chips
usually store a day-of-week value, but it’s useless in this application
for two reasons: first, the BIOS does not expose it. Second, there is no
universally-accepted way to interpret it (which day does the week start
on? Is ‘0’ a valid day of the week?)</p>

<h4 id="notes_23">Notes</h4>
<p>I’ve tested this utility with the DS1302 clock board designed by Ed
Brindly, and on the interrupt-driven timer built into my Z180 board.
However, it does not interact with hardware, only BIOS; I would expect
it to work with other hardware.</p>
<p>wdate checks for the non-existence of RomWBW, and also for failing
operations on the RTC. It will display the terse “No RTC” message in
both cases.</p>
<p>The RomWBW functions that manipulate the date and time operate on BCD
numbers, as RTC chips themselves usually do. wdate works in decimal, so
that it can check that the user input makes sense. A substantial part of
the program’s code is taken up by number format conversion and range
checking.</p>

<p><code>XM</code> attempts to determine the best way to drive the serial port based
on your hardware configuration. When possible, it will bypass the HBIOS
for faster operation. However, in many cases, it will use HBIOS so that
flow control can be used.</p>
<p><code>XM</code> is dependent on a reliable communications channel. You must ensure
that the serial port can be serviced fast enough by either using a baud
rate that is low enough or ensuring that hardware flow control is fully
functional (end to end).</p>
<h4 id="etymology_20">Etymology</h4>
<p>The <code>XM</code> application provided in RomWBW is an adaptation of a
pre-existing XModem application. Based on the source code comments, it
was originally adapted from Ward Christensen’s MODEM2 by Keith Petersen
and is labeled version 12.5.</p>
<p>The original source of the application was found on the Walnut Creek
CD-ROM and is called XMDM125.ARK dated 7/15/86.</p>
<p>The actual application is virtually untouched in the RomWBW adaptation.
The majority of the work was in the modem driver which was enhanced to
detect the hardware being used and dynamically choose the appropriate
driver.</p>

<p><code>ZMP</code> is a terminal program for interacting with a modem attached to
your system. It includes X/Y/ZModem file transfer protocols. An actual
modem is not required, but you must have a port for ZMP to use that is
independent of the console running <code>ZMP</code>.</p>
<h4 id="syntax_24">Syntax</h4>
<p><code>ZMD</code> <em>[\&lt;unit&gt;]</em></p>
<p><em>\&lt;unit&gt;</em> can specify a single digit (0-9) indicating the RomWBW
Character Unit to use for the modem port.</p>
<h4 id="usage_25">Usage</h4>
<p>Refer to the file <code>ZMP.DOC</code> found on all disk images that include the
<code>ZMP</code> application.</p>
<h4 id="notes_26">Notes</h4>
<p><code>ZMP</code> requires access to multiple overlay and configuration files to
run. It will look for these on the default driver and user area.
Depending the operating system used, you may be able to set up a search
path and locate these files in other locations. The files used by <code>ZMP</code>
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ZMP.HLP</code></li>
<li><code>ZMP.DOC</code></li>
<li><code>ZMP.CFG</code></li>
<li><code>ZMP.FON</code></li>
<li><code>ZMXFER.OVR</code></li>
<li><code>ZMTERM.OVR</code></li>
<li><code>ZMINIT.OVR</code></li>
<li><code>ZMCONFIG.OVR</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>ZMP</code> console is always the active OS console. If no <em>\&lt;unit&gt;</em> is
specified on the command line, <code>ZMP</code> will default to using HBIOS
Character Unit 1 as the modem port. Take care to avoid using the same
HBIOS Character Unit as both the console and the modem or various
strangeness will occur.</p>
<p><code>ZMP</code> is a full screen application and is configured to use ANSI/VT-100
screen control.</p>
<p><code>ZMP</code> does not support the range of port configurations provided by
RomWBW. The RomWBW adaptation of <code>ZMP</code> ignores the port configuration
options within <code>ZMP</code>. Instead, you should configure the HBIOS Character
Unit using the RomWBW MODE command before launching <code>ZMP</code>.</p>
<p><code>ZMP</code> is written in C. As a result, file transfers will be noticeably
slower than other assembly language file transfer tools.</p>
<h4 id="etymology_22">Etymology</h4>
<p>ZMP was produced by Ron Murray and was based on HMODEM II. Wayne
Hortensius updated the source to compile with the latest version of
Hi-Tech C and implemented a few enhancements.</p>

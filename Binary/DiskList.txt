This directory ("Binary") is part of the RomWBW System Software 
distribution archive.  Refer to the ReadMe.txt file in this 
directory for more information on the overall contents of the 
directory.

RomWBW includes a set of disk images that are ready to copy onto
a floppy or hard/CF/SD disk.  You can use your modern computer
(Windows/Linux/Mac) to copy the disk image file onto your disk
media.  The disk media will then be ready to use in your RomWBW
System.

WARNING: The hdnew_*.img disk images are part of a new disk
format that is a work in progress.  Do not use these disk
images without knowing exactly what you are doing!  The
hd_*.img disk images continue to be the images you should
be using under normal circumstances.

A description of the disk images is provided later in this file.
For more information on the creatioin of these images including
instructions for customizing them or creating your own, refer to
the ReadMe.txt file in the Source\Images directory.

Installing Images
-----------------

The following instructions apply to Windows computers.  Alternatively,
you can use the "dd" command on Linux or Mac.

First of all, a MAJOR WARNING!!!!  The tools described below are 
quite capable of obliterating your running Windows system drive.  Use 
with extreme caution and make sure you have backups.

To install a floppy image on floppy media, you can use the tool 
called RaWriteWin.  This tool is included in the Tools directory of 
the distribution. This tool will write your floppy image (fd_xxx.img) 
to a floppy disk using a raw block transfer.  The tool is GUI based 
and it's operation is self explanatory.

To install a hard disk image on a CF card or SD card, you must have 
the appropriate media card slot on your computer. If you do, you can 
use the tool called Win32DiskImager. This tool is also included in 
the Tools directory of the distribution.  It will write your 
hard disk image (hd_xxx.img) to the designated media card.  This tool 
is also GUI based and self explanatory.

The use of the SIMH emulator is outside of the scope of this document.  
However, if you use SIMH, you will find that you can attach the hard 
disk images to the emulator with lines such as the following in your 
SIMH configuration file:

  | attach hdsk0 hd_cpm22.img
  | set hdsk0 format=HDSK
  | set hdsk0 geom=T:2048/N:256/S:512
  | set hdsk0 wrtenb
  
Making Disk Images Bootable
---------------------------

The Operating System disk images below are ready to boot by the
RomWBW Boot Loader.  However, if you update your RomWBW ROM, then
you should also update the system tracks of your bootable disk
images.  You would use SYSCOPY to do this.  SYSCOPY can also be
used to make a disk bootable if it is not already bootable.

You would use a command like the following to make drive C bootable:

  | B>SYSCOPY C:=CPM.SYS

The system file to use depends on the operating system you are trying
to boot from the slice you are initializing with SYSCOPY:

  CP/M 2.2 - cpm.sys
  ZSDOS 1.1 - zsys.sys
  CP/M 3 - cpmldr.sys
  ZPM3 - cpmldr.sys
  
Slices
------

A RomWBW CP/M filesystem is fixed at 8MB.  This is because it is the 
largest size filesystem supported by all common CP/M variants. Since 
all modern hard disks (including SD Cards and CF Cards) are much 
larger than 8MB, RomWBW supports the concept of "slices".  This 
simply means that you can concatenate multiple CP/M filesystems (up 
to 256 of them) on a single physical hard disk and RomWBW will allow 
you to assign drive letters to them and treat them as multiple 
independent CP/M drives.

With the exception of the hd_combo image, each of the disk images
includes a single CP/M file system (i.e., a single slice).  However,
you can easily create a multi-slice disk image by merely concatenating 
multiple images together.  For example, if you wanted to create a 2 
slice disk image that has ZSDOS in the first slice and Wordstar in 
the second slice, you could use the following command from a Windows 
command prompt:

  | C:\RomWBW\Binary>copy /b hd_zsdos.img + hd_ws.img hd_multi.img

You can now write hd_multi.img onto your SD or CF Card and you will 
have ZSDOS in the first slice and Wordstar in the second slice.

The hd_combo disk image is an example of this.  It contains several
slices in one image file.  The contents of this special disk image
are described below.

The concept of slices applies ONLY to hard disks.  Floppy disks are 
not large enough to support multiple slices.

Disk Image Contents
-------------------

What follows is a brief description of the contents of the
disk images automatically provided in the RomWBW distribution.
Note that all of the OS images include the RomWBW custom
support apps.

cpm22 - DRI CP/M 2.2 (Bootable Floppy and Hard Disk)

  Standard DRI CP/M 2.2 distribution files along with a few commonly
  used utilities.

zsdos - ZCPR1 + ZSDOS 1.1 (Bootable Floppy and Hard Disk)

  Contains ZCPR1 and ZSDOS 1.1.  This is roughly equivalent to the
  ROM boot contents, but provides a full set of the applications
  and related files that would not all fit on the ROM drive.

nzcom - NZCOM (Bootable Floppy and Hard Disk)

  Standard NZCOM distribution.  Note that you will need to run the
  NZCOM setup before this will run properly.  You will need
  to refer to the NZCOM documentation.  

cpm3 - DRI CP/M3 (Bootable Floppy and Hard Disk)

  Standard DRI CP/M 3 adaptation for RomWBW that is ready to run.
  It can be started by running CPMLDR.

zpm3 - ZPM3 (Bootable Floppy and Hard Disk)

  Simeon Cran's ZCPR 3 compatible OS for CP/M 3 adapted for RomWBW and 
  ready to run.  It can be started by running CPMLDR (which seems 
  wrong, but ZPMLDR is somewhat broken).

ws4 - WordStar 4 (Floppy and Hard Disk)

  Micropro Wordstar 4 full distribution.  This image is not bootable
  and is intended to be added as an additional slice to an OS image.

bp - BPBIOS (Hard Disk only)

  Adaptation of BPBIOS for RomWBW.  This is NOT complete and NOT
  useable in it's current state.

combo - Multi-Boot Combination (Bootable Hard Disk)

  A pre-created combo image that contains the following slices.  The
  slices are identical to the individual images listed above.

    Slice 0: cpm22 (bootable)
    Slice 1: zsdos (bootable)
    Slice 2: nzcom (bootable)
    Slice 3: cpm3 (bootable)
    Slice 4: zpm3 (bootable)
    Slice 5: ws4 (not bootable)

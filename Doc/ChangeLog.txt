Older Stuff
-----------

This work is all derived from JC110508.  Note that JC110508 included
the fix for DPB in CBIOS for large ROM drive.  Specifically, EXM_5
was changed from 1 -> 0 (as it should have been).

1) Fixed the stack location in loader-b.asm.  LOADER.COM was not working
for me without this change.

2) Fixed the size of the ccp+bdos+cbios in bloader.asm and loader-b.asm.
It was too small before and would be a potential problem depending on
how many of the optional features were enabled.

3) Fixed the "MON" command in cpm.  It was jumping to an old/bad location.
I modified the way it works a bit to handle the situation where it can
become overlaid.  There is now a routine in cbios.asm to reload it and
branch to the warm start location.  The address of the cbios routine is
now saved in the cbios scratch area of zero page (40H) so that ccp does
not need to have a hard coded location in it.

4) Corrected ROM memory layout a bit.  Small ROM drive was starting at the
wrong location (4800H).  It should have been 5000H.  So, I gave the loader
2K more space.  Required modifications to bloader and cbios.  Renamed
'romdsk.dsk' to 'romdsk.dat' to help alert folks to the fact that this is
a different image and allows "clean" to remove anything with a suffix
of '.img'.

5) Changed bloader to allow selection of DSKY or UART monitor using JP2.
A single ROM can now be dynamically configured to start via DSKY or UART.

6) Fixed small ROM disk DPB in cbios.  Changed DSM_6 from 31 -> 11.  Based
on blocksize of 1024 and the fact that it is now a 12K area, 11 is the
correct value.  Also fixed EXM_6 from 1 -> 0 (per DRI spec).

7) Moved startup message from warm boot to cold boot.  Also moved VDU init
to cold boot -- seems appropriate, but I have no way to test this yet...

8) More DPB tweaks.  I have reviewed the floppy and RAM/ROM DPB's.  I have
not looked at ATAPI or IDE.  May still be problems in those.

9) Complete overhaul of build scripts.  Reworked makefile to be compatible
with the make utility from gcc and created MakeRom.cmd to invoke the gcc
make utility.  Created a PowerShell script as an alternative way to create
ROM (BuildRom.ps1) and created BuildRom.cmd to invoke it.  Final ROM
image is now called rom.img -- made more sense to me, but I have no
compelling justification for changing that.  BuildRom2.bat is still
there and I think it works.

10) Played with the startup message in cbios a bit.  Extracted the "build"
id and moved it to the top of the file.  My intent is to make it easy to
update.  Ultimately, I wold prefer that it be updated with the current
date of the build as part of the build scripts, but still debating how
best to accomplish that.

11) Related to #10, I have extracted the 3rd party build tools into sibling
directories.  So, for example, tasm is now found at tasm32.  This makes it
very easy to update the 3rd party tools and to clearly differentiate the
3rd party tool files.  All build script have been updated as needed.

12) Removed ALL enable interrupt (EI) instructions in CBIOS.  By leaving
interrupts disabled the BIOS will now start OK even if some vagrant
hardware is asserting an interrupt (DISKIO).  Seems like this is better
anyway -- general idea is that we only enable interupts precisely
when desired for very specific controled purposes since there is no
concept of interrupt dispatching available.

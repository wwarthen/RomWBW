Introduction:
============
DDTZ v2.7 is a complete replacement for DDT,  Digital  Research's 
famous Dynamic Debugging Tool,  with improved functionality,  bug 
extermination,  and full Z80 support.  In general,  DDTZ is fully 
compatible  with  the  original utility,  but it  has  extra  and 
extended  commands  and  many  fewer  quirks.   All  Z80-specific 
instructions can be (dis)assembled,  though in Intel rather  then 
Zilog format. Furthermore, DDTZ will correctly trace ('T' and 'U' 
commands) both 8080 and Z80 instructions,  depending on which CPU 
is operating.  On startup,  the program announces which CPU it is 
running on.

DDTZ v2.7 now handles the 64180 added opcodes.  It does NOT  test 
for  a  64180 CPU,  since this cannot be done  without  executing 
illegal   Z80  instructions,   which  in  turn  will  crash  some 
simulators.  However v2.7 does not execute any 64180 instructions 
internally, only in the subject program.

This  issue supplies the "M" version assembled,  to avoid  errors 
when switching between MSDOS and CPM systems.   The command table 
is updated accordingly.  Most CPM users are also MSDOS users, but 
not vice-versa.

The program is invoked by typing

      ddtz<ret>
or
      ddtz [d:]filespec<ret>

In  the  second  form,  DDTZ will load the  specified  file  into  
memory starting at 0100H,  unless it's a .HEX file that sets  its 
own  load  address.  Besides reporting the NEXT free address  and  
the PC (program counter) after a successful load, DDTZ also shows 
the number of memory pages needed for a SAVE.  Instead of  having 
to write all this down,  just use the 'X' command at any time  to 
redisplay these three values for the current application.

NOTE:  loading  more  code above the NEXT pointer  revises  these 
       values.

As  in DDT,  when a program is loaded above the area holding  the 
'A'  and  'U'  (and now 'W') command  code,  these  commands  are 
disabled,  and the extra memory  is released to the user.   Thus,  
DDTZ can occupy  as little as 3K total memory space.  Unlike DDT,  
however,  DDTZ will not overwrite itself or the system on program 
loads (except .HEX files).

At initialization,  the stack pointer (SP) points to a return  to 
DDTZ,  just like for the CCP. Thus, programs that normally return 
to   the  CCP  will  be  returned  to  DDTZ.    The  'B'  command  
reinitializes this condition.


The intercept vector copies  the BDOS version number,   etc.,  so 
an  object program  does not know that  DDTZ is running   (except 
for BIOS-BDOS vector size). Thus, programs that check the version 
number should execute correctly under DDTZ.

All input parameters can now be entered in any of three formats:

       (1) hexadecimal (as in DDT),
       (2) decimal, by adding a leading '#' character,
       (3) ASCII, by enclosing between either single or double
           quotes; either one or two characters are allowed.

Leading  blanks  in  command lines and parameters  are  absorbed. 
Either  a  comma  or a (single) space   is   a  valid  delimiter.   
Either uppercase or lowercase input is accepted.

The  default command  (for anything  not otherwise  recognizable)  
is 'H'.  This allows convenient calculation, along with the other 
features described below.   So,  to convert a number,  just enter 
it!

As  in  DDT,   the prompt character is '-',  and the  only  error 
message  is  the query ('?'),  which generally kicks you back  to 
command mode. 

New Commands (Over DDT):
=======================

NOTE: letters in parenthesis,  e.g.  "(U)",  show the  equivalent 
      command for DDTZM version (compatible with MSDOS debug).

   @  Sets  or  shows (with no parameter)  the internally  stored 
      "base" value.   Also used with the 'S' and 'D' commands  as 
      an optional parameter  (though without the '@')  to display 
      memory  from an arbitrary base marker (offset). When set to 
      zero (the default), it does not affect any screen displays.

   B  B)egin: resets the USER stack pointer to its initial value, 
      such  that any program that exits by an RET will return  to 
      DDTZ.   DDTZ   provides    a  default   stack   space    of 
      approximately 24 bytes for user programs.

   C  C)ompare first_address,last_address,against_address:  shows 
      all  the byte differences between two memory areas,  in the 
      format

       XXXX aa YYYY bb

      where  XXXX and YYYY  are the comparative memory addresses, 
      and aa  and  bb  are the corresponding byte values.  Can be 
      used  to  verify   the identity  of  two  files   by  first 
      loading  them   into  different memory areas with  the  'R' 
      command (see below).


   W  Write:   stores the modified memory area to disk under  the 
  (K) filename  specified  by the 'I'  command,  overwriting  the 
      original file from which it was loaded (the user is queried 
      before  doing  so).  By default,  the image of memory  from 
      0100H through the "NEXT" value -1 is saved.  "K first_addr, 
      last_address"  overrides this and allows writing ANY memory 
      area to a file. Almost a necessity for CPM 3.0 (no SAVE!).
      K)eep on DDTZ

   X  eXamine:  redisplays the "NEXT PC SAVE" report at any time.
  (Q) Q)uery size on DDTZ.

   S  S)earch  first_address,   last_addr,  value:  searches  the 
  (W) specified memory area for the value (a 16-bit word,  not  a 
      byte) and shows the locations of all such.  Very useful for 
      finding  CALL's  or JMP's to a particular address, etc.
      W)here on DDTZ

   Y  Y)our_option  parm1,parm2,address:  executes  an  arbitrary 
      routine  at  the  specified address,   with the BC  and  DE 
      registers  set to parm1 and parm2, respectively.

   Z  Displays (but does not alter) the Z80's alternate  register 
      set,  including the index registers (disabled if running on 
      an  8080).  On Z80's,   automatically included  as the last 
      part of the display by the 'X' command.


Based (Offset) Displays:
=======================
 
The  'D' and 'E' commands  can use a stored base value  (offset),  
as  set  by   the  '@' command.   The current  @  value   may  be 
overridden for a single execution of these commands by adding the 
base as an extra parameter  in the command line.   The effect  is  
to  add  this  value   to  the  first/last  address  and  display 
accordingly.  The address listing on the left becomes  XXXX:YYYY,  
where  XXXX  is the offset address and YYYY is the actual  memory 
address being displayed.   For example,  if you have a data  area  
located at  42B7H  and wish to  preserve easy access,  just enter 
"@42b7".  Now, "d0,3f" will dump memory starting at 4237H.


Further Changes from DDT:
========================

   A  A)ssemble  now  accepts   the  full Z80  as  well  as  8080 
      instruction  set,  although it expects them in Intel rather 
      than  Zilog  format  (see  notes  below   under   the   'L' 
      command).    When in doubt, see the mnemnonic list below.

   D  D)isplay or D)ump  will accept  an optional third parameter  
      to  set the base value for a single execution only.  Format 
      has been cleaned up.

   H  H)ex_arithmetic    on   two  values   also   shows    their 
      difference  in decimal.  With only one value,  converts  to 
      hexadecimal, decimal, and ASCII (low-order byte only).


   N  N)ame  now allows drive specification  (d:...)  and sets up 
  (I) the  complete  command  line,   including  both  FCB's  (at 
      addresses 005CH and 006CH).   The tail (stored at 0081H up) 
      is NOT upshifted.
      I)nput on DDTZ

   U  U)nassemble now displays the raw hexcode,  especially handy 
  (L) when examining non-code areas. Intel (8080 style) mnemonics 
      are  used,  so  some  disassembled  instructions  may  look 
      strange.  E.g., the Z80's 'IN B,(C)' and 'OUT (C),B' become  
      'INP B' and 'OUTP B', respectively;  'LD (nnnn),BC' becomes 
      'SBCD nnnn',  'ADD IX,  BC' becomes 'DADX B', and 'JP (IX)' 
      becomes 'PCIX'. 
      L)ist on DDTZ

   L  L)oad   now  permits  loading a file into memory   with  an 
  (R) offset,  which  is  added to the default  load  address  of 
      0100H.   When reading in  a .HEX file  with  a preset bias,  
      the   'R'  command will not transfer control to an  invalid 
      execution point.  Another execution of the 'R' command will 
      reread the input file, e.g.:

         n blah<ret>
         l<ret>
         ...modify the code and generally mess about...
         l<ret>

      The original file  is reloaded,  and the modifications  are 
      removed.
      R)ead on DDTZ

   E  E)nter,  like  D)isplay,  now  accepts an  optional  second 
  (S) parameter  to  set the base value for  a  single  execution 
      only.
      S)ubstitute or S)et on DDTZ

   T  T)rap/trace   on  termination  now shows  the complete  CPU 
      state. Traps and traces no longer lock up  when  a user RST 
      7 instruction is executed.   Tracing of BDOS/BIOS calls  is 
      heavily trun cated,  avoiding clutter and preventing system 
      crashes.

NOTE: Most of the UNDOCUMENTED Z80 op-codes are handled.  Others
      can crash the system.

   R  R)egisters  also shows what two-byte values the HL  and  SP 
  (X) registers are actually pointing to.  On Z80's, displays the 
      alternate register set.
      eX)amine on DDTZ

NOTE: Any  use  of the 'W' or 'L' command  resets the system  DMA 
      transfer address to the standard default value of 0080H.

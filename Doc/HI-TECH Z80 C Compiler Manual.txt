       1. Introduction


            The HI-TECH C Compiler  is  a  set  of  software  which
       translates  programs written in the C language to executable
       machine code programs. Versions are available which  compile
       programs  for  operation under the host operating system, or
       which produce programs for  execution  in  embedded  systems
       without an operating system.

       1.1. Features

            Some of HI-TECH C's features are:

            A single command will compile, assemble and link entire
            programs.

            The compiler performs strong type checking  and  issues
            warnings  about  various constructs which may represent
            programming errors.

            The generated code is extremely small and fast in  exe-
            cution.

            A full run-time library is  provided  implementing  all
            standard C input/output and other functions.

            The source code for all run-time routines is provided.

            A powerful general purpose macro assembler is included.

            Programs may be generated to  execute  under  the  host
            operating  system,  or  customized  for installation in
            ROM.

   1.2. System Requirements

        The HI-TECH C Compilers  operate  under  the  operating
   sytems  listed  in  table  1. Ensure that the version of the
   compiler you have matches the system you have.  Note that in
   general  you  must  have  a hard disk or two floppy disks on
   your system (it is possible to use one floppy disk  of  800K
   or  more).   A  hard disk is strongly recommended. Note that
   the CP/M-80 native compiler does not have all  the  features
   described  in  this manual, as it has not been upgraded past
   V3.09 due to memory limitations.   The  Z80  cross  compiler
   does  support  all of the features described here and can be
   used to generate programs to execute under CP/M-80.

   1.3. Using this Manual

        The documentation supplied with the HI-TECH C  compiler
   comprises  two  separate  manuals within the one binder. The
   manual you are reading now covers all versions of  the  com-
   piler  (reflecting  the  portable nature of the compiler). A
   separate manual covers machine  dependent  aspects  of  your
   compiler, e.g. installation.

        This  manual  assumes  you  are  familiar  with  the  C
   language  already.  If you are not, you should have at least
   one reference book covering C, of which a large  number  are
   available  from most computer bookstores, e.g. "A Book on C"
   by Kelley and Pohl. Other suitable texts are "Programming in
   ANSI  C"  by  S. Kochan and "The C Programming Language", by
   Kernighan and Ritchie. You should read the "Getting Started"
   chapter  in  this  manual, and the "Installation" chapter in
   the machine-specific manual.  This  will  provide  you  with
   sufficient  information  to  work  through  the introductory
   examples in the C reference you are using.

        Once you have a basic grasp  of  the  C  language,  the
   remainder  of  this manual will provide you with information
   to enable you to explore the more advanced aspects of C.

        Most of the manual covers all  implementations  of  the
   HI-TECH  C  compiler.  A separate manual is provided for the
   macro assembler  for  your  particular  machine,  and  other
   machine-dependent information.

       2. Getting Started


            If using the compiler on a hard disk  system  you  will
       need  to  install  the  compiler  before  using  it. See the
       "Installation" chapter for more details.  If using a  floppy
       disk  based system, in general you should have a copy of the
       distribution disk #1 in drive A: and maintain your files  on
       a disk in the B: drive. Again see the "Installation" chapter
       for more information.

            main()
            {
                    printf("Hello, world\n");
            }


                         Fig. 1. Sample C Program


            Before compiling your program it must be contained in a
       file  with an extension (or file type, i.e. that part of the
       name after the '.') of .C.  For example  you  may  type  the
       program shown in fig. 1 into a file called HELLO.C. You will
       need a text editor to do this.  Generally  any  text  editor
       that can create a straight ASCII file (i.e. not a "word pro-
       cessor" type file) will be suitable. If using  editors  such
       as  Wordstar,  you should use the "non-document mode".  Once
       you have the program in such a file all that is required  to
       compile  it  is  to  issue  the  C  command, e.g. to compile
       HELLO.C simply type the command

            C -V HELLO.C

       Cross compilers (i.e. compilers that operate on  one  system
       but  produce  code for a separate target system) will have a
       compiler driver named slightly differently, e.g. the  68HC11
       cross compiler driver is called C68.

            If you are using a floppy disk based system (or a  CP/M
       system)  it  may be necessary to specify where to find the C
       command, e.g. if the C command is on a disk in drive A:  and
       you are working on B:, type the command

            A:C -V HELLO.C


            The compiler will issue a sign on message, then proceed
       to execute the various passes of the compiler in sequence to
       compile the program. If you are using a  floppy  disk  based
       system  where the compiler will not fit on a single disk you
       will be prompted to change disks whenever the compiler  can-
       not  find  a  pass. In this case you should insert a copy of
       the next distribution disk in drive A: and press RETURN.

            As each pass of the compiler is about to be executed, a
       command  line  to that pass will be displayed on the screen.

   This is because the -V option has been used. This stands for
   Verbose,  and  had  it  not been given the compilation would
   have been silent except for the sign on message.  Error mes-
   sages can be redirected to a file by using the standard out-
   put redirection notation, e.g. > _s_o_m_e_f_i_l_e.

        After completion of compilation, the compiler will exit
   to  command  level.   You will notice that several temporary
   files created during compilation will have been deleted, and
   all  that  will be left on the disk (apart from the original
   source file HELLO.C) will be an executable file. The name of
   this executable file will be HELLO.EXE for MS-DOS, HELLO.PRG
   for the Atari ST, HELLO.COM for CP/M-80  and  HELLO.CMD  for
   CP/M-86.  For cross compilers it will be called HELLO.HEX or
   HELLO.BIN depending on the default  output  format  for  the
   particular compiler.  To execute this program, simply type

        HELLO

   and you should be rewarded with the message "Hello,  world!"
   on  your screen.  If you are using a cross compiler you will
   need to put the program into EPROM or download to the target
   system  to  execute  it. Cross compilers do not produce pro-
   grams executable on the host system.

        There are other options that may be  used  with  the  C
   command,  but  you will not need to use them unless you wish
   to do so. If you are new to the C language it will be advis-
   able  to enter and compile a few simple programs (e.g. drawn
   from one of the C reference texts  mentioned  above)  before
   exploring other capabilities of the HI-TECH C compiler.

        There is one exception to the above; if you  compile  a
   program  which  uses  floating  point  arithmetic (i.e. real
   numbers) you MUST specify to the compiler that the  floating
   point  library  should  be searched. This is done with a -LF
   option at the END of the command line, e.g.

        C -V FLOAT.C -LF

       3. Compiler Structure


            The compiler is made up of several passes; each pass is
       implemented  as  a  separate  program.  Note  that it is not
       necessary for the user to invoke each pass individually,  as
       the  C  command runs each pass automatically.  Note that the
       machine dependent passes are named differently for each pro-
       cessor,  for example those with 86 in their name are for the
       8086 and those with 68K in their name are for the 68000.

            The passes are:

       CPP  The pre-processor - handles macros and conditional com-
            pilation

       P1   The syntax and  semantic  analysis  pass.  This  writes
            intermediate code for the code generator to read.

       CGEN, CG86 etc.
            The code generator - produces assembler code.

       OPTIM, OPT86 etc.
            The code improver - may optionally be omitted, reducing
            compilation  time at a cost of larger, slower code pro-
            duced.

       ZAS, AS86 etc.
            The assembler - in fact a general purpose macro  assem-
            bler.

       LINK
            The link editor - links object files with libraries.

       OBJTOHEX
            This utility converts  the  output  of  LINK  into  the
            appropriate  executable  file format (e.g. .EXE or .PRG
            or .HEX).

            The passes are invoked in the order  given.  Each  pass
       reads  a  file  and writes a file for its successor to read.
       Each intermediate file has a particular format; CPP produces
       C code without the macro definitions and with uses of macros
       expanded; P1 writes a file containing a program in an inter-
       mediate code; CGEN translates this to assembly code; AS pro-
       duces object code, a binary  format  containing  code  bytes
       along  with relocation and symbol information.  LINK accepts
       object files  and  libraries  of  object  files  and  writes
       another  object file; this may be in absolute form or it may
       preserve relocation information and be input to another LINK
       command.

            There are also other utility programs:

       LIBR
            Creates and maintains libraries of object modules

       4. Operating Details


            HI-TECH C was designed for ease of use; a  single  com-
       mand will compile, assemble and link a C program. The syntax
       of the C command is as follows:

            C [ options ] files [ libraries ]

            The options are zero or more options,  each  consisting
       of  a dash ('-'), a single key letter, and possibly an argu-
       ment following the key letter with no intervening space. The
       files  are  one  or  more  C  source files, assembler source
       files, or object  files.  Libraries  may  be  zero  or  more
       library  names, or the abbreviated form -lname which will be
       expanded to the library name libname.lib.

            The C command will,  as  determined  by  the  specified
       options,  compile  any  C  source files given, assemble them
       into object code unless requested  otherwise,  assemble  any
       assembler  source  files specified, then link the results of
       the assemblies with any object or library files specified.

            If the C command is invoked without arguments, then  it
       will  prompt  for a command line to be entered. This command
       line may be extended by typing a backslash ('\') on the  end
       of  the  line.  Another  line will then be requested. If the
       standard input of the command is from a file (e.g. by typing
       C  <  afile)  then  the command lines will be read from that
       file. Within the file more than one line  may  be  given  if
       each line but the last ends with a backslash. Note that this
       mechanism does not work in MS-DOS batch file, i.e. the  com-
       mand  file for the C command must be a separate file. MS-DOS
       has no mechanism for providing long command lines  or  stan-
       dard input from inside a batch file.

            The options recognized by the C command are as follows:

       -S   Leave the results of compilation  of  any  C  files  as
            assembler output. C source code will be interspersed as
            comments in the assembler code.

       -C   Leave the results of all  compiles  and  assemblies  as
            object files; do not invoke the linker. This allows the
            linker to be invoked separately, or via the  C  command
            at a later stage.

       -CR  Produce a cross reference listing. -CR on its own  will
            leave  the  raw  cross-reference  information in a tem-
            porary file, allowing the user to run CREF  explicitly,
            while  supplying  a  file  name,  e.g. -CR_F_R_E_D._C_R_F will
            cause CREF to be invoked to process the raw information
            into the specified file, in this case _F_R_E_D._C_R_F.

       -CPM
            For the Z80 cross compiler only,  produce  CP/M-80  COM
            files.   Unless the -CPM option is given, the Z80 cross






   Page 8                               HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

        compiler uses the ROM runtime startoff module and  pro-
        duces  hex  or  binary  images.   If the -CPM option is
        given, CP/M-80 runtime startoff code is linked used and
        a CP/M-80 COM file is produced.

   -O   Invoke  the  optimizer  on  all  compiled  code;   also
        requests the assembler to perform jump optimization.

   -O_O_U_T_F_I_L_E
        Specify a name for the executable file to  be  created.
        By  default the name for the executable file is derived
        from the name of the first source or object file speci-
        fied to the compiler. This option allows the default to
        be overridden. If no dot ('.')  appears  in  the  given
        file  name, an extension appropriate for the particular
        operating system will be added, e.g. -O_F_R_E_D  will  gen-
        erate a file _F_R_E_D._E_X_E on MS-DOS or _F_R_E_D._C_M_D on CP/M-86.
        For cross compilers this  also  provides  a  means  for
        specifying the output format, e.g. specifying an output
        file _P_R_O_G._B_I_N will make the compiler generate a  binary
        file, while specifying _P_R_O_G._H_E_X will make it generate a
        hexadecimal file.

   -V   Verbose: each step of the compilation will be echoed as
        it is executed.

   -I   Specify an additional filename prefix to use in search-
        ing  for #include files. For CP/M the default prefix is
        0:A: (user number 0, disk  drive  A).  For  MS-DOS  the
        default  prefix is A:\HITECH\. Under Unix and Xenix the
        default prefix is /usr/hitech/include/.  Note  that  on
        MS-DOS  a  trailing  backslash  must be appended to any
        directory  name  given  as  an  argument  to  -I;  e.g.
        -I\FRED\  not  -I\FRED.  Under  Unix  a  trailing slash
        should be added.

   -D   Define a symbol to the preprocessor:  e.g.  -DCPM  will
        define the symbol CPM as though via #define CPM 1.

   -U   Undefine a pre-defined symbol. The complement of -D.

   -F   Request the linker to produce a symbol  file,  for  use
        with the debugger.

   -R   For the Z80 CP/M compiler only this option will link in
        code  to  perform command line I/O redirection and wild
        card expansion in file names.  See the  description  of
        _getargs()  in  appendix 5 for details of the syntax of
        the redirections.

   -X   Strip local symbols from any files compiled,  assembled
        or linked. Only global symbols will remain.

   -M   Request the linker to produce a link map.

   -A   This option, for the Z80 only, will cause the  compiler
        to  produce  an executable program that will, on execu-
        tion, self-relocate  itself  to  the  top  of  the  TPA






       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                               Page 9

            (Transient  Program  Area).  This allows the writing of
            programs which may execute other programs  under  them-
            selves.   Note that a program compiled in such a manner
            will not automatically reset the bdos address at  loca-
            tion 6 in order to protect itself. This must be done by
            the program itself.

            For cross compilers this provides a way  of  specifying
            to  the  linker the addresses that the compiled program
            is to be  linked  at.  The  format  of  the  option  is
            -A_R_O_M_A_D_R,_R_A_M_A_D_R,_R_A_M_S_I_Z_E.  _R_O_M_A_D_R  is the address of the
            ROM in the system, and is where the executable code and
            initialized  data  will  be placed. _R_A_M_A_D_R is the start
            address of RAM, and is where  the  bss  psect  will  be
            placed,  i.e.  uninitialized data.  _R_A_M_S_I_Z_E is the size
            of RAM available to the program, and is used to set the
            top of the stack.

            For the 6801/6301/68HC11 compiler, the -A option  takes
            a  fourth  value  which  is  the address of a four byte
            direct page area called ctemp which the  compiled  code
            uses as a scratch pad.  If the ctemp address is omitted
            from the -A option, it defaults to address 0.  Normally
            this  will  be  acceptable,  however some 6801 variants
            (like the 6303) have memory mapped I/O ports at address
            0 and start their direct page RAM at address $80.

            For the large memory model of the 8051 compiler, the -A
            option  takes  the form -A_R_O_M_A_D_R,_I_N_T_R_A_M,_E_X_T_R_A_M,_E_X_T_S_I_Z_E.
            _R_O_M_A_D_R is the address of ROM in the system.  _I_N_T_R_A_M  is
            the  start  address  of  internal RAM, and is where the
            rbss psect will be placed.   The  8051  internal  stack
            will  start after the end of the rbss psect.  _E_X_T_R_A_M is
            the start address of external RAM, and is where the bss
            psect  will be placed.  _E_X_T_S_I_Z_E is the size of external
            RAM available to the program, and is used  to  set  the
            top of the external stack.

       -B   For compilers  which  support  more  than  one  "memory
            model",  this  option  is  used  to select which memory
            model code is to be generated for.  The format of  this
            option is -Bx where x is one or more letters specifying
            which memory model to use.  For the 8086,  this  option
            is  used  to  select  which  one  of five memory models
            (Tiny, Small, Medium, Compact or Large) is to be used.

            For the 8051 compiler  this  this  option  is  used  to
            select  which  one  of  the three memory models (Small,
            Medium or Large) is to be used.  For the 8051  compiler
            only,  this  option  can  also be used to select static
            allocation of _a_u_t_o variables by appending an A  to  the
            end  of  the -B option.  For example, -Bsa would select
            small model with static allocation  of  all  variables,
            while -Bm would select medium model with _a_u_t_o variables
            dynamically allocated on the stack.









   Page 10                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   -E   By default the 8086 compiler will initialize  the  exe-
        cutable  file  header  to request a 64K data segment at
        run time. This may be overridden by the -E  option.  It
        takes  an  argument (usually in hexadecimal representa-
        tion) which is the number of BYTES (not paragraphs)  to
        be  allocated  to  the program at run time. For example
        -E0ffff0h will request a megabyte. Since this much will
        not be available, the operating system will allocate as
        much as it can.

   -W   This options sets the warning level, i.e. it determines
        how  picky the compiler is about legal but dubious type
        conversions etc. -W0 will allow  all  warning  messages
        (default),   -W1  will  suppress  the  message  "Func()
        declared implicit int". -W3 is recommended for  compil-
        ing  code  originally  written with other, less strict,
        compilers. -W9 will suppress all warning messages.

   -H   This option  generates  a  symbol  file  for  use  with
        debuggers.  The  format of the symbol file is described
        elsewhere. The default  name  of  the  symbol  file  is
        _l._s_y_m.  An  alternate  name  may  be  specfied with the
        option, e.g. -H_s_y_m_f_i_l_e._a_b_c.

   -G   Like -H, -G also generates a symbol file, but one  that
        contains  line and file number information for a source
        level debugger. Like -H a file name may  be  specified.
        When  used in conjunction with -O, only partial optimi-
        zation  will  be  performed  to  avoid  confusing   the
        debugger.

   -P   Execution profiling is available  on  native  compilers
        running  under  DOS,  CP/M-86 and on the Atari ST. This
        option generates code to turn  on  execution  profiling
        when  the  program  is  run. A -H option should also be
        specified to provide a symbol table  for  the  profiler
        EPROF.

   -Z   For version 5.xx compilers only, the -Z option is  used
        to  select  global  optimization of the code generated.
        For the 8086 and 6801/6301/68HC11  compilers  the  only
        valid  -Z  option  is  -Zg.  For the 8051 compiler, the
        valid -Z options are -Zg which invokes global optimiza-
        tion,  -Zs  which  optimizes  for  space, and -Zf which
        optimizes for speed.  The s and f options may  be  used
        with  the  g option, thus the options -Zgf and -Zgs are
        valid.   Speed  and  space  optimization  are  mutually
        exclusive,  i.e.  the  s  and  f options cannot be used
        together.

   -1   For the 8086 compiler only, request the  generation  of
        code which takes advantage of the extra instructions of
        the 80186 processor. A program compiled  with  -1  will
        not execute on an 8086 or 8088 processor. For the 68000
        compiler, generate instructions for the  68010  proces-
        sor.








       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 11

       -2   Like -1 but for the 80286 and 68020.

       -11  For the 6801/HC11 compiler, this  option  will  request
            generation  of instructions specific to the 68HC11 pro-
            cessor.

       -6301
            For the 6801/HC11 compiler, this  option  will  request
            generation  of  instructions  specific to the 6301/6303
            processors.

            Some examples of the use of the C command are:

       c prog.c

       c -mlink.map prog.c x.obj -lx

       c -S prog.c

       c -O -C -CRprog.crf prog.c prog2.c

       c -v -Oxfile.exe afile.obj anfile.c -lf


            Upper and lower case has been used in the  above  exam-
       ples for emphasis: the compiler does not distinguish between
       cases, although arguments specifying  names,  e.g.  -D,  are
       inherently case sensitive.

            Taking the above examples in order; the first  compiles
       and  links  the  C  source  file  prog.c with the standard C
       library. The second example will compile the file prog.c and
       link it with the object file x.obj and the library libx.lib;
       a link map will be written to the file link.map.

            The third example compiles the file prog.c, leaving the
       assembler  output  in  a  file prog.as. It does not assemble
       this file or invoke the linker.  The next  example  compiles
       both  prog.c  and  prog2.c,  invoking  the optimizer on both
       files, but does not perform any linking. A  cross  reference
       listing will be left in the file _p_r_o_g._c_r_f.

            The last example pertains to the 8086  version  of  the
       compiler,  It runs the compiler with the verbose option, and
       will cause anfile.c to be compiled without  optimization  to
       object   code,   yielding  anfile.obj,  then  afile.obj  and
       anfile.obj will be linked together with the  floating  point
       library  (from  the  -LF option) and the standard library to
       yield the executable program  xfile.exe  (assuming  this  is
       performed  on an MS-DOS system).  One would expect this pro-
       gram to use floating point, if  it  did  not  then  the  -LF
       option would have been required.

            If more than one C or assembler source file is given to
       the  C command, the name of each file will be printed on the
       console as it is processed.  If any fatal errors occur  dur-
       ing  the  compilation  or  assembly of source files, further
       source files will be processed, but the linker will  not  be

   invoked.


        Other commands which may be issued by the user,  rather
   than automatically by the C command, are:

   ZAS  The Z80 assembler.

   AS86
        The 8086 assembler.

   LINK
        The linker

   LIBR
        The library maintainer

   OBJTOHEX
        Object to hex converter

   CREF
        Cross reference generator.

        In general, these commands accept the same type of com-
   mand line as the C command, i.e. zero or more options (indi-
   cated by a leading '-') followed by one or more  file  argu-
   ments.  If  the  linker  or the librarian is invoked with no
   arguments, it wll prompt for a  command  line.  This  allows
   command  lines  of more than 128 bytes to be entered.  Input
   may also be taken from a file by using the redirection capa-
   blities  (see  _getargs()  in the library function listing).
   See the discussion above of the C command.   These  commands
   are described in further detail in their respective manuals.

       5. Specific Features


            The HI-TECH C compiler has a number of features,  which
       while  largely compatible with other C compilers, contribute
       to more reliable programming methods.

       5.1. ANSI C Standard Compatibility

            At the time of writing the Draft ANSI Standard for  the
       C Language was at an advanced stage, though not yet an offi-
       cial standard. Accordingly it is not possible to claim  com-
       pliance  with  that standard, however HI-TECH C includes the
       majority of the new and altered features in the  draft  ANSI
       standard.  Thus  it  is in the sense that most people under-
       stand it "ANSI compatible".

       5.2. Type Checking

            Previous C compilers have adopted  a  lax  approach  to
       type  checking.  This  is  typified  by the Unix C compiler,
       which allows almost arbritary mixing  of  types  in  expres-
       sions. The HI-TECH C compiler performs much more strict type
       checking, although in most cases only warning  messages  are
       issued,  allowing  compilation  to proceed if the user knows
       that the errors are harmless. This would occur, for example,
       when  an  integer  value was assigned to a pointer variable.
       The generated code would almost certainly be what  the  user
       intended,  however if in fact it represented an error in the
       source code, the user is prompted to check  and  correct  it
       where necessary.

       5.3. Member Names

            In early C compilers member names in  different  struc-
       tures were required to be distinct except under certain cir-
       cumstances. HI-TECH C, like most recent  implementations  of
       C, allows member names in different structures and unions to
       overlap.  A member name is recognized only in the context of
       an  expression  whose type is that of the structure in which
       the member is defined.  In practice this means that a member
       name  will  be recognized only to the right of a '.' or '->'
       operator, where the expression to the left of  the  operator
       is  of  type  structure  or pointer to structure the same as
       that in which the member name was declared.  This  not  only
       allows  structure  names  to  be re-used without conflict in
       more than one structure, it permits strict checking  of  the
       usage  of  members; a common error with other C compilers is
       the use of a member name with a  structure  pointer  of  the
       wrong type, or worse with a variable which is a pointer to a
       simple type.

            There is however an escape from this,  where  the  user
       desires to use as a structure pointer something which is not
       declared as such. This is via the use  of  a  typecast.  For
       example, suppose it is desired to access a memory-mapped i/o
       device, consisting of several  registers.  The  declarations






   Page 14                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   and use may look something like the code fragment in fig. 2.

   struct io_dev
   {
           short   io_status;    /* status */
           char    io_rxdata;    /* rx data */
           char    io_txdata;    /* tx data */
   };

   #define RXRDY   01           /* rx ready */
   #define TXRDY   02           /* tx ready */

   /* define the (absolute) device address */

   #define DEVICE  ((struct io_dev *)0xFF00)

   send_byte(c)
   char c;
   {
           /* wait till transmitter ready */
           while(!(DEVICE->io_status & TXRDY))
                   continue;
           /* send the data byte */
           DEVICE->io_txdata = c;
   }

          Fig. 2. Use of Typecast on an Absolute Address


        In this example, the device in question has  a  16  bit
   status  port,  and  two 8 bit data ports. The address of the
   device (i.e. the address of its status  port)  is  given  as
   (hex)0FF00.  This address is typecast to the required struc-
   ture pointer type to enable  use  of  the  structure  member
   names.  The  code generated by this will use absolute memory
   references to access the device, as required.

        Some examples of right and wrong usage of member  names
   are shown in fig. 3.

   5.4. Unsigned Types

        HI-TECH C implements unsigned versions of all  integral
   types;  i.e.   unsigned  char,  short,  int and long.  If an
   unsigned quantity is shifted right, the shift will  be  per-
   formed  as  a  logical  shift,  i.e. bringing zeros into the
   rightmost bits. Similarly right shifts of a signed  quantity
   will sign extend the rightmost bits.

   5.5. Arithmetic Operations

        On machines where arithmetic  operations  may  be  per-
   formed   more  efficiently  in  lengths  shorter  than  int,
   operands shorter than int will not be extended to int length
   unless necessary.

        For example, if two characters are added and the result
   stored  into  another  character,  it  is  only necessary to

       struct fred
       {
             char      a;
             int       b;
       }     s1, * s2;

       struct bill
       {
               float   c;
               long    b;
       }       x1, * x2;

       main()
       {
               /* wrong - c is not a member of fred */
               s1.c = 2;

               /* correct */
               s1.a = 2;

               /* wrong - s2 is a pointer */
               s2.a = 2;

               /* correct */
               x2->b = 24L;

               /* right, but note type conversion
                       from long to int */
               s2->b = x2->b;
       }

                     Fig. 3. Examples of Member Usage

       perform arithmetic in 8 bits, since any  overflow  into  the
       top  8 bits will be lost. However, if the sum of two charac-
       ters is stored into an int, the addition should be  done  in
       16 bits to ensure the correct result.

            In accordance with the draft ANSI standard,  operations
       on  float rather than double quantities will be performed in
       the shorter precision rather than being converted to  double
       precision then back again.

       5.6. Structure Operations

            HI-TECH C implements structure  assignments,  structure
       arguments  and structure-valued functions in their full gen-
       erality. The example in fig. 4 is  a  function  returning  a
       structure. Some legal (and illegal) uses of the function are
       also shown.

   struct bill
   {
           char    a;
           int     b;
   }
   afunc()
   {
           struct bill     x;

           return x;
   }

   main()
   {
           struct bill     a;

           a = afunc();            /* ok */
           pf("%d", afunc().a);    /* ok */

           /* illegal, afunc() cannot be assigned
                   to, therefore neither can
                   afunc().a */
           afunc().a = 1;

           /* illegal, same reason */
           afunc().a++;
   }

   5.7. Enumerated Types

        HI-TECH C supports enumerated types;  these  provide  a
   structured way of defining named constants.

        The uses of enumerated types are more  restricted  than
   that  allowed by the Unix C compiler, yet more flexible than
   permitted  by  LINT.  In  particular,   an   expression   of
   enumerated type may be used to dimension arrays, as an array
   index or as the operand of a switch  statement.   Arithmetic
   may  be  performed  on enumerated types, and enumerated type
   expressions may be compared, both for equality and with  the
   relation  operators.  An example of the use of an enumerated
   type is given in fig. 5.

   5.8. Initialization Syntax

        Kernighan and Ritchie in "The C  Programming  Language"
   state  that  pairs of braces may be omitted from an initial-
   izer in certain contexts; the draft ANSI  standard  provides
   that  a  conforming C program must either include all braces
   in an initializer, or leave them all out. HI-TECH  C  allows
   any  pairs  of braces to be omitted providing that the front
   end of the compiler can determine the  size  of  any  arrays
   being  initialized, and providing that there is no ambiguity
   as to which braces have been omitted. To avoid ambiguity  if
   any  pairs of braces are present then any braces which would

       /* a represents 0, b -> 1 */
       enum fred { a, b, c = 4 };

       main()
       {
               enum fred       x, y, z;

               x = z;
               if(x < z)
                       func();
               x = (enum fred)3;
               switch(z) {
               case a:
               case b:
               default:
               }
       }

                    Fig. 5. Use of an Enumerated Type

       enclose those braces must also be present. The compiler will
       complain  ("initialization  syntax")  if  any  ambiguity  is
       present.

       5.9. Function Prototypes

            A new feature of C included in the proposed ANSI for C,
       known  as "function prototypes", provides C with an argument
       checking facility, i.e. it allows the compiler to  check  at
       compile  time  that  actual arguments supplied to a function
       invocation  are  consistent  with  the   formal   parameters
       expected  by the function. The feature allows the programmer
       to include in a function  declaration  (either  an  external
       declaration or an actual definition) the types of the param-
       eters to that function.   For  example,  the  code  fragment
       shown in fig. 6 shows two function prototypes.

            void fred(int, long, char *);

            char *
            bill(int a, short b, ...)
            {
                    return a;
            }

                       Fig. 6. Function Prototypes


            The first prototype is an external declaration  of  the
       function  _f_r_e_d(),  which  accepts  one integer argument, one
       long argument, and one argument which is a pointer to  char.
       Any  usage  of  _f_r_e_d() while the prototype declaration is in
       scope will cause the actual parameters  to  be  checked  for
       number  and  type  against  the  prototype, e.g. if only two
       arguments were supplied or an integral  value  was  supplied
       for the third argument the compiler would report an error.







   Page 18                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

        In the second example, the function _b_i_l_l() expects  two
   or more arguments. The first and second will be converted to
   int and short respectively, while the remainder (if present)
   may  be  of any type. The ellipsis symbol (...) indicates to
   the compiler that zero or more arguments  of  any  type  may
   follow the other arguments. The ellipsis symbol must be last
   in the argument list, and may not appear as the  only  argu-
   ment in a prototype.

        All prototypes for a function must agree exactly,  how-
   ever  it  is legal for a definition of a function in the old
   style,  i.e.  with  just  the  parameter  names  inside  the
   parentheses,  to follow a prototype declaration provided the
   number and type of the arguments agree. In this case  it  is
   essential  that  the  function definition is in scope of the
   prototype declaration.

        Access to unspecified arguments  (i.e.  arguments  sup-
   plied where an ellipsis appeared in a prototype) must be via
   the macros defined  in  the  header  file  <stdarg.h>.  This
   defines the macros _v_a__s_t_a_r_t, _v_a__a_r_g and _v_a__e_n_d. See _v_a__s_t_a_r_t
   in the library function listing for more information.

        NOTE that is is a grave error to use a  function  which
   has  an  associated  prototype  unless  that prototype is in
   scope, i.e. the prototype MUST be declared  (possibly  in  a
   header  file)  before  the  function is invoked.  Failure to
   comply with this rule may result in strange behaviour of the
   program.  HI-TECH  C  will  issue a warning message ("func()
   declared  implicit  int")  whenever  a  function  is  called
   without  an  explicit  declaration.   It is good practice to
   declare all functions and global variables in  one  or  more
   header  files  which are included wherever the functions are
   defined or referenced.

   5.10. Void and Pointer to Void

        The _v_o_i_d type may be used to indicate to  the  compiler
   that  a  function  does not return a value. Any usage of the
   return value from a void function  will  be  flagged  as  an
   error.

        The type _v_o_i_d *, i.e. pointer to void, may be used as a
   "universal"  pointer type. This is intended to assist in the
   writing of general purpose storage allocators and the  like,
   where a pointer is returned which may be assigned to another
   variable of some other pointer type.  The  compiler  permits
   without  typecasting  and  without  reporting  an  error the
   conversion of _v_o_i_d * to any  other  pointer  type  and  vice
   versa.  The programmer is advised to use this facility care-
   fully and ensure that any  _v_o_i_d  *  value  is  usable  as  a
   pointer  to  any  other type, e.g. the alignment of any such
   pointer should be suitable for storage of any object.

       5.11. Type qualifiers

            The ANSI C standard  introduced  the  concept  of  _t_y_p_e
       _q_u_a_l_i_f_i_e_r_s to C; these are keywords that qualify the type to
       which they are applied.  The type qualifiers defined by ANSI
       C are const and volatile.  HI-TECH C also implements several
       other type qualifiers.  The extra qualifiers include:

            far
            near
            interrupt
            fast interrupt
            port

       Not all versions of the compilers implement all of the extra
       qualifiers.  See  the  machine dependent section for further
       information.

            When constructing declarations using  type  qualifiers,
       it  is very easy to be confused as to the exact semantics of
       the declaration. A couple of rules-of-thumb will  make  this
       easier.  Firstly, where a type qualifier appears at the left
       of a declaration  it  may  appear  with  any  storage  class
       specifier and the basic type in any order, e.g.

            static void interrupt   func();

       is semantically the same as

            interrupt static void   func();


            Where a qualifier appears in this context,  it  applies
       to  the  basic  type  of  the declaration. Where a qualifier
       appears to the right of  one  or  more  '*'  (_s_t_a_r)  pointer
       modifiers,  then  you should read the declaration from right
       to left, e.g.

            char * far fred;

       should be read as "fred is a  far  pointer  to  char".  This
       means  that  fred is qualified by _f_a_r, not the char to which
       it points. On the other hand,

            char far * bill;

       should be read as "bill is a pointer to a  far  char",  i.e.
       the  char to which bill points is located in the far address
       space. In the context of the 8086 compiler  this  will  mean
       that  bill  is  a  32  bit  pointer  while  fred is a 16 bit
       pointer. You will hear bill referred to as a "far  pointer",
       however the terminology "pointer to far" is preferred.

   5.12.

        There are two methods provided  for  in-line  assembler
   code  in  C  programs.   The  first  allows several lines of
   assembler anywhere in a program. This is via  the  #asm  and
   #endasm  preprocessor  directives.   Any lines between these
   two directives will be copied straight through to the assem-
   bler  file  produced  by the compiler. Alternatively you can
   use the asm("_s_t_r_i_n_g"); construct anywhere a C  statement  is
   expected. The _s_t_r_i_n_g will be copied through to the assembler
   file. Care should be  taken  with  using  in-line  assembler
   since it may interact with compiler generated code.

   5.13. Pragma Directives

        The draft  ANSI  C  standard  provides  for  a  #pragma
   preprocessor  directive that allows compiler implementations
   to control  various  aspects  of  the  compilation  process.
   Currently  HI-TECH  C  only  supports  one  pragma, the _p_a_c_k
   directive. This allows control  over  the  manner  in  which
   members  are  allocated inside a structure. By default, some
   of the compilers (especially the 8086 and  68000  compilers)
   will  align structure members onto even boundaries to optim-
   ize machine accesses. It is sometimes  desired  to  override
   this  to achieve a particular layout inside a structure. The
   _p_a_c_k pragma allows specification of a maximum  packing  fac-
   tor.  For  example,  #pragma pack1(1) will instruct the com-
   piler that no additional padding be inserted between  struc-
   ture  members,  i.e.  that  all members should be aligned on
   boundaries divisible by 1. Similarly  #pragma  pack(2)  will
   allow  alignment  on  boundaries  divisible by 2. In no case
   will use of the _p_a_c_k pragma force a greater  alignment  than
   would have been used for that data type anyway.

        More that one _p_a_c_k pragma may be used in a program. Any
   use  will  remain  in force until changed by another _p_a_c_k or
   until the end of the file. Do not use a _p_a_c_k  pragma  before
   include files such as <_s_t_d_i_o._h> as this will cause incorrect
   declarations of run-time library data structures.

       6. Machine Dependencies


            HI-TECH C eliminates  many  of  the  machine  dependent
       aspects of C, since it uniformly implements such features as
       unsigned char. There are however certain areas where machine
       dependencies  are  inherent  in  the C language; programmers
       should be aware of these and take  them  into  account  when
       writing portable code.

            The most obvious of these machine dependencies  is  the
       varying  size of C types; on some machines an int will be 16
       bits, on others it may be 32 bits. HI-TECH C conforms to the
       following  rules,  which represent common practice in most C
       compilers.

            char    is at least 8 bits
            short   is at least 16 bits
            long    is at least 32 bits
            int     is the same as either short or long
            float   is at least 32 bits
            double  is at least as wide as float


            Because of the variable width of an int, it  is  recom-
       mended  that  short  or  long  be  used wherever possible in
       preference to int. The exception to this is where a quantity
       is  required  to  correspond to the natural word size of the
       machine.

            Another area of machine differences  is  that  of  byte
       ordering;  the ordering of bytes in a short or long can vary
       significantly between machines. There is no easy approach to
       this  problem  other  than  to avoid code which depends on a
       particular ordering. In particular you should avoid  writing
       out  whole  structures  to  a file (via _f_w_r_i_t_e()) unless the
       file is only to be read by the same  program  then  deleted.
       Different compilers use different amounts of padding between
       structure members, though  this  can  be  modified  via  the
       #pragma pack(n) construct.

       6.1. Predefined Macros

            One technique through which machine unavoidable machine
       dependencies  may  be  managed is the predefined macros pro-
       vided by each compiler to identify the target processor  and
       operating system (if any). These are defined by the compiler
       driver  and  may  be  tested  with  conditional  compilation
       preprocessor directives.

            The macros defined by various compilers are  listed  in
       table 2. These can be used as shown in the example in fig .

       7. Error Checking and Reporting


            Errors may be reported by any  pass  of  the  compiler,
       however  in  practice  the  assembler and optimizer will not
       encounter any errors in the generated  code.  The  types  of
       errors  produced by each pass are summarized below.  In gen-
       eral any error will be indentified by the name of the source
       file  in  which  it  was encountered, and the line number at
       which it was detected.  P1 will also nominate  the  name  of
       the function inside which the error was detected.

            Errors may be redirected to a file with the usual  syn-
       tax, i.e. a 'greater than' symbol ('>') followed by the name
       of a file into which the errors should be written. The  file
       name  may of course be a device name, e.g.  LST: for CP/M or
       PRN for MS-DOS.

            CPP will report errors relating  to  macro  definitions
       and expansions, as well as conditional compilation.

            P1 is the pass which reports most errors;  it  performs
       syntax  and  semantic checking of the input, and will report
       both fatal  and  warning  errors  when  encountered.  Syntax
       errors  will  normally  be expressed as "symbol expected" or
       "symbol unexpected". Semantic errors  may  relate  to  unde-
       clared,  redeclared  or misdeclared variables.  P1 will also
       report variable definitons which are unused or unreferenced.
       These errors are warnings, as are most type checking errors.

            When P1 encounters errors it will list the source  line
       containing  the  error on the screen, and underneath display
       the error message and an up arrow pointing to the  point  at
       which  the  compiler  detected  the error. In some cases the
       actual cause of the error may be earlier in the line or even
       on previous line.

            CGEN may occasionally report errors, usually  warnings,
       and  mostly  related  to  unusual combinations of types with
       constants, for example testing if an  unsigned  quantity  is
       less  than  zero. One fatal error produced by CGEN is "can't
       generate code  for  this  expression"  and  means  that  the
       expression  currently being compiled is in some way too com-
       plicated to produce code for. This can usually  be  overcome
       by  rewriting the source code. Such errors are rare and will
       occur only for unusual constructs.

            The linker will report undefined  or  multiply  defined
       symbols.  Note  that  variable  declarations inside a header
       file which is included in more than one source file must  be
       declared as extern, to avoid multiply defined symbol errors.
       These symbols must then be  defined  in  one  and  one  only
       source file.

            A comprehensive list of error messages is  included  in
       an appendix.

       8. Standard Libraries


       8.1. Standard I/O

            C is a language which does not specify the  I/O  facil-
       ites in the language itself; rather all I/O is performed via
       library routines. In practice this results in  I/O  handling
       which  is  no  less convenient than any other language, with
       the added possibility of customising the I/O for a  specific
       application. For example it is possible to provide a routine
       to replace the standard getchar() (which gets one  character
       from  the  standard input) with a special getchar(). This is
       particulary useful when writing code which is to  run  on  a
       special  hardware  configuration,  while  maintaining a high
       level of compatibility with "standard" C I/O.

            There is in fact a Standard I/O library  (STDIO)  which
       defines  a  portable set of I/O routines. These are the rou-
       tines which are normally used by any C application  program.
       These  routines,  along with other non-I/O library routines,
       are listed in detail in a subsequent section of the manual.

       8.2. Compatibility

            The libraries supplied with HI-TECH C are highly compa-
       tible  with  the  ANSI  libraries,  as  well  as the V7 UNIX
       libraries, both at the Standard I/O level and the UNIX  sys-
       tem  call  level.  The Standard I/O library is complete, and
       conforms in all respects with the UNIX Standard I/O library.
       The  library  routines  implementing  UNIX  system call like
       functions are as close as possible to  those  system  calls,
       however  there  are  some  UNIX  system calls that cannot be
       simulated on other systems, e.g.  the link() operation. How-
       ever  the  basic  low  level I/O routines, i.e. open, close,
       read, write and lseek are identical to the UNIX equivalents.
       This  means  that many programs written to run on UNIX, even
       if they do not use Standard I/O, will run with little modif-
       ication when compiled with HI-TECH C.

       8.3. Libraries for Embedded Systems

            The cross compilers, designed to produce code for  tar-
       get  systems  without  operating  systems, are supplied with
       libraries implementing a subset of the STDIO functions.  Not
       provided  are  those  functions dealing with files. Included
       are _p_r_i_n_t_f(), _s_c_a_n_f() etc. These operate by calling two  low
       level  functions  _p_u_t_c_h and _g_e_t_c_h() which typically send and
       receive characters via a serial port. Where the compiler  is
       aimed  at  a  single-chip  micro  with on-board UART this is
       used.  The source code for all these functions  is  supplied
       enabling the user to modify it to address a different serial
       port.










   Page 26                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   8.4. Binary I/O

        On some operating  systems,  notably  CP/M,  files  are
   treated  differently according to whether they contain ASCII
   (i.e. printable) or binary data.  MD-DOS also  suffers  from
   this  problem,  not  due to any lack in the operating system
   itself, but rather because of the hangover from  CP/M  which
   results  in  many programs putting a redundant ctrl-Z at the
   end of files.  Unfortunately there is no  way  to  determine
   which  type  of  data a file contains (except perhaps by the
   name or type of the file, and  this  is  not  reliable).  To
   overcome  this difficulty, there is an extra character which
   may be included in the MODE string to  a  fopen()  call.  To
   open a file for ASCII I/O, the form of the fopen() call is:

   fopen("filename.ext", "r")      /* for reading */
   fopen("filename.ext", "w")      /* for writing */

   To open a file for binary I/O,  the  character  'b'  may  be
   appended to the

   fopen("filename.ext", "rb")
   fopen("filename.ext", "wb")


        The additional character instructs  the  STDIO  library
   that  this file is to be handled in a strict binary fashion.
   On CP/M or MS-DOS, a file opened in ASCII mode will have the
   following  special character handling performed by the STDIO
   routines:

   newline
        ('\n') converted to carriage return/newline on output.

   return
        ('\r') ignored on input

   Ctrl-Z
        interpreted as End-Of-File on input and, for CP/M only,
        appended when closing the file.

        The special actions performed  on  ASCII  files  ensure
   that  the  file is written in a format compatible with other
   programs handling text files, while eliminating the require-
   ment for any special handling by the user program - the file
   appears to the user program as though it  were  a  UNIX-like
   text file.

        None of these special actions are performed on  a  file
   opened  in  binary mode.  This is required when handling any
   kind of binary data, to ensure that spurious bytes  are  not
   inserted, and premature EOF's are not seen.

        Since the binary mode character is  additional  to  the
   normal  mode  character, this usage is quite compatible with
   UNIX C. When compiled on UNIX, the additional character will
   be ignored.







       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 27

            A mention here of the  term  `stream'  is  appropriate;
       stream  is used in relation to the STDIO library routines to
       mean the source or sink of bytes (characters) manipulated by
       those  routines.  Thus the FILE pointer supplied as an argu-
       ment to the STDIO routines may be regarded as  a  handle  on
       the  corresponding  stream.   A  stream  may  be viewed as a
       featureless sequence of bytes,  originating  from  or  being
       sent  to  a  device or file or even some other indeterminate
       source. A FILE pointer should not be confused with the 'file
       descriptors'  used  with the low-level I/O functions _o_p_e_n(),
       _c_l_o_s_e(), _r_e_a_d() and _w_r_i_t_e(). These form an independent group
       of  I/O  functions which perform unbuffered reads and writes
       to files.

       8.5. Floating Point Library

            HI-TECH C  supports  floating  point  as  part  of  the
       language,  however  the  Z80  implementation provides single
       precision only; double floats are permitted but are no  dif-
       ferent   to  floats.  In  addition,  the  standard  library,
       LIBC.LIB, does not  contain  any  floating  point  routines.
       These   have   been  separated  out  into  another  library,
       LIBF.LIB. This means that if this library is not searched no
       floating  point  support  routines  will  be linked in, thus
       avoiding any size penalty for the floating point support  if
       it is not used. This is particulary important for printf and
       scanf, and thus LIBF.LIB contains  versions  of  printf  and
       scanf that do support floating point formats.

            Thus, if floating point is used, a -LF option should be
       used  AFTER the source and/or object files to the C command.
       E.g.:

            C -V -O x.c y.c z.obj -LF

       9. Stylistic Considerations


            Although it is not the purpose of this  manual  to  set
       out  a coding standard for C, some comments regarding use of
       some of the features of HI-TECH C may be useful.

       9.1. Member Names

            Although HI-TECH C allows the same structure  or  union
       member  name to be used in more than one structure or union,
       this may not be allowed  by  another  C  compiler.  To  help
       ensure  portability  of  the  code,  it  is recommended that
       member names all be distinct, and a useful way  of  ensuring
       this  is  to prefix each member name with one or two letters
       derived from the name of the structure itself. An example is
       given in fig. 7.

       struct tree_node
       {
               struct tree_node *      t_left;
               struct tree_node *      t_right;
               short                   t_operator;
       };


                          Fig. 7. Member Naming


            Because HI-TECH C insists on use  of  all  intermediate
       names when referencing a member nested inside several struc-
       tures, some simple macro definitions can serve as  a  short-
       hand. An example is given in fig. 8.

       struct tree_node
       {
           short       t_operator;
           union
           {
               struct tree_node *  t_un_sub[2];
               char *              t_un_name;
               long                t_un_val;
           }   t_un;
       };

       #define t_left  t_un.t_un_sub[0]
       #define t_right t_un.t_un_sub[1]
       #define t_name  t_un.t_un_name
       #define t_val   t_un.t_un_val


                      Fig. 8. Member Name Shorthand


            This enables the variant components of the structure to
       be  referred to by short names, while guaranteeing portabil-
       ity and presenting a clean definition of the structure.






   Page 30                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   9.2. Use of Int

        It is recommended that the type int be avoided wherever
   possible,  in preference to the types short or long. This is
   because of the variable size of int, whereas short  is  com-
   monly 16 bits and long 32 bits in most C implementations.

   9.3. Extern Declarations

        Some compilers permit a non-initialized global variable
   to  be  declared  in  more than one place, with the multiple
   definitions being resolved by the linker as all defining the
   same  thing. HI-TECH C specifically disallows this, since it
   may lead to subtle bugs. Instead, global  variables  may  be
   declared  extern  in as many places as you wish, and must be
   defined in one and one only place. Typically this will  mean
   declaring  global  variables in a header file as extern, and
   defining each variable in the file most  closely  associated
   with that variable.

        This usage will be portable to  virually  all  other  C
   implementations.

       10. Memory Models


            With many of the processors supported by the HI-TECH  C
       compilers  there  are more than one address space accessible
       to a program. Typically one address space is more economical
       to  access  than  another,  larger address space. Thus it is
       desirable to be able to tailor a prorgram's use of memory to
       achieve  the greatest economy in addressing (thus minimizing
       program size and maximizing speed) while allowing access  to
       as much memory as the program requires.

            This concept of different address spaces is not catered
       for  by either K&R or ANSI C (except to recognize the possi-
       bility of  separate  address  spaces  for  code  and  data).
       Without any extensions to the language itself it is possible
       to devise more than one memory model for a given  processor,
       selected  at  compile time. This has the effect of selecting
       one addressing method for all data and/or code. This permits
       the model for a particular program to be chosen depending on
       that program's memory requirements.

            In many programs, however, only one or two data  struc-
       tures  are  large  enough to need to be placed in the larger
       address space. Selection of a "large" memory model  for  the
       whole  of  the  program  makes  the whole program larger and
       slower just to allow a few large data structures.  This  can
       be  overcome by allowing individual selection of the address
       space for each data structure.  Unfortunately  this  entails
       extensions  to  the language, never a desirable approach. To
       minimize the effect of such extensions they  should  satisfy
       the following criteria:

       1.   As far as possible the extensions should be  consistent
            with common practice.

       2.   The extensions should fit a  machine-independent  model
            to maximize portability across processors and operating
            systems.

            These goals have been  achieved  within  HI-TECH  C  by
       means of the following model:

            Each memory model  defines  three  address  spaces
            each  for code and data.  These address spaces are
            known as the _n_e_a_r, _f_a_r  and  _d_e_f_a_u_l_t  spaces.  Any
            object  qualified  by  the  near  keyword  will be
            placed in the _n_e_a_r address space, any object qual-
            ified  by  the  far keyword shall be placed in the
            _f_a_r address space, and all other objects shall  be
            placed  in  the  _d_e_f_a_u_l_t  address  space. The _n_e_a_r
            address space shall be a (possibly improper)  sub-
            space  of  the  _d_e_f_a_u_l_t  address  space, while the
            _d_e_f_a_u_l_t  address  space  shall  be   a   (possibly
            improper) subspace of the _f_a_r address space. There
            shall be up to three kinds of pointers correspond-
            ing  to  the three address spaces, each capable of






   Page 32                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

        addressing an object in its own address space or a
        subspace of that address space.

        This implies that the address of an object may be  con-
   verted to a pointer into a larger address space, e.g. a _n_e_a_r
   object may have its address converted to a pointer  to  _f_a_r,
   but  a  _f_a_r  object  may  not  be  able to be addressed by a
   pointer to _n_e_a_r.

        In practice the  _d_e_f_a_u_l_t  address  space  will  usually
   correspond exactly to either the _n_e_a_r or _f_a_r address spaces.
   If all three address spaces correspond to  the  same  memory
   then  there  is  only one memory model possible. This occurs
   with the 68000 processor. Where the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t  code  and  data
   spaces may each correspond to either the _n_e_a_r or _f_a_r address
   spaces then there will be a total  of  four  memory  models.
   This is the case with the 8086 processor.

        The keywords far and near are supported by all the  HI-
   TECH  C  compilers,  but the exact correspondence of address
   spaces is determined by the  individual  characteristics  of
   each processor and the choice of memory model (if there is a
   choice). However code written using these keywords  will  be
   portable  providing  it  obeys  the constraints of the model
   described above.

        This model also corresponds well with other implementa-
   tions  using the near and far keywords, although such imple-
   mentations do not appear to have been designed around a for-
   mal, portable model.

       11. What Went Wrong


            There are numerous error messages that the compiler may
       produce.  Most  of these relate to errors in the source code
       (syntax errors of various  kinds  and  so  forth)  but  some
       represent  limitations,  particularly  of  memory.  The  two
       passes most likely to be affected by memory limitations  are
       the  code  generator  and  the optimizer. The code generator
       will issue the message "No room" if it runs out  of  dynamic
       memory.  This  can  usually be eliminated by simplifying the
       expression at the line nominated in the error  message.  The
       more  complex the expression, the more memory is required to
       store the tree representing it. Reducing the number of  sym-
       bols used in the program will also help.

            Note that this error  is  different  from  the  message
       "Can't  generate  code  for this expression" which indicates
       that the expression is in some way  too  difficult  for  the
       code  generator  to handle. This message will be encountered
       very infrequently, and can be  eliminated  by  changing  the
       expression in some way, e.g. computing an intermediate value
       into a temporary variable.

            The optimizer reads the  assembler  code  for  a  whole
       function  into memory at one time. Very large functions will
       not fit, giving the error message "Optim: out of  memory  in
       _func"  where  func is the name of the function responsible.
       In this case the function should be broken up  into  smaller
       functions.  This will only occur with functions with several
       hundred lines of C source code. Good  coding  practice  will
       normally limit functions to less than 50 lines each.

            If a pass exits with the message "Error closing  file",
       or  "Write error on file", this usually indicates that there
       is insufficient room on the current disk.

            If you use a wordprocessing editor  such  as  Wordstar,
       ensure  that you use the "non-document" mode or whatever the
       corresponding mode is. The edited file  should  not  contain
       any  characters  with the high bit set, and the line feed at
       the end of the line must be present.  Lines  should  be  not
       more than 255 characters long.

            When using floating point, ensure that you  use  a  -LF
       flag  at  the END of the command line, to cause the floating
       point library to be searched. This will cause floating  ver-
       sions  of  printf  and  scanf  to  be  linked in, as well as
       specific floating point routines.

            If the non-floating version of printf is  used  with  a
       floating  format  such  as  %f then it will simply print the
       letter f.

            If the linker gives an "Undefined symbol"  message  for
       some  symbol  which  you  know nothing about, it is possible
       that it is a library routine which was not found during  the






   Page 34                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   library  search  due  to incorrect library ordering. In this
   case you can search the library twice, e.g.  for  the  stan-
   dard  library add a -LC to the end of the C command line, or
   -LF for the floating library.  If  you  have  specified  the
   library by name simply repeat its name.

       12. Z80 Assembler Reference Manual


       12.1. Introduction

            The assembler incorporated in the  HI-TECH  C  compiler
       system is a full-featured relocating macro assembler accept-
       ing Zilog mnemonics. These mnemonics and the syntax  of  the
       Z80  assembly  language  are  described in the "Z80 Assembly
       Language Handbook" published by Zilog and  are  included  at
       the  end of this manual as a reference. The assembler imple-
       ments certain extensions to the operands allowed,  and  cer-
       tain  additional  pseudo-ops, which are described here.  The
       assembler also accepts the additional opcodes for the  Hita-
       chi 64180 and Z180 processors.

       12.2. Usage

            The assembler is named zas, and is invoked as follows:

            ZAS options files ...


            The files are one or more assembler source files  which
       will be assembled, but note that all the files are assembled
       as one, not as separate files.  To assemble separate  files,
       the  assembler  must be invoked on each file separately. The
       options are zero or more options from the following list:

       -N   Ignore arithmetic  overflow  in  expressions.   The  -N
            option suppresses the normal check for arithmetic over-
            flow. The assembler follows the "Z80 Assembly  Language
            Handbook"  in its treatment of overflow, and in certain
            instances this can lead to an error where in  fact  the
            expression  does  evaluate  to  what the user intended.
            This option may be used to override the overflow check-
            ing.

       -J   Attempt to optimize jumps to branches.  The  -J  option
            will request the assembler to attempt to assemble jumps
            and conditional jumps as relative branches where possi-
            ble.   Only   those   conditional   jumps  with  branch
            equivalents will be optimized, and jumps will  only  be
            optimized  to  branches  where  the target is in branch
            range. Note that the  use  of  this  option  slows  the
            assembly  down,  due to the necessity for the assembler
            to make an additional pass over the input code.

       -U   Treat undefined symbols as  external.   The  -U  option
            will suppress error messages relating to undefined sym-
            bols. Such symbols are  treated  as  externals  in  any
            case.  The use of this option will not alter the object
            code generated, but merely serves to suppress the error
            messages.









   Page 36                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   -O_f_i_l_e
        Place the object code in _f_i_l_e.  The default object file
        name  is  constructed from the name of the first source
        file. Any suffix or file type (i.e. anything  following
        the  rightmost  dot  ('.') in the name is stripped, and
        the suffix .obj appended. Thus the command

             ZAS file1.as file2.z80

        will produce an object file called file1.obj.  The  use
        of the -O option will override this default convention,
        allowing the object file to be arbitrarily  named.  For
        example:

             ZAS -ox.obj file1.obj

        will place the object code in x.obj.

   -L_l_i_s_t
        Place an assembly listing in the file _l_i_s_t, or on stan-
        dard  output if _l_i_s_t is null A listfile may be produced
        with the -L option. If a file name is supplied  to  the
        option,  the  list file will be created with that name,
        otherwise the listing will be written to standard  out-
        put  (i.e.  the  console). List file names such as CON:
        and LST: are acceptable.

   -W_w_i_d_t_h
        The listing is to be formatted for a printer  of  given
        _w_i_d_t_h  The  -W  option specifies the width to which the
        listing is to be formatted. E.g.

             ZAS -Llst: -W80 x.as

        will output  a  listing  formatted  for  an  80  column
        printer to the list device.

   -C   This options requests ZAS to  produce  cross  reference
        information  in a file. The file will be called _x_x_x.crf
        where _x_x_x is the base part of  the  first  source  file
        name. It will then be necessary to run the CREF utility
        to turn this information into a formatted listing.

   12.3. The Assembly Language

        As mentioned above, the assembly language  accepted  by
   zas  is  based  on the Zilog mnemonics. You should have some
   reference book such as the "Z80 Assembly Language Handbook".
   Described below are those areas in which zas differs, or has
   extensions,  compared  to  the   standard   Zilog   assembly
   language.

   12.3.1. Symbols

        The symbols (labels) accepted by the assembler  may  be
   of any length, and all characters are significant. The char-
   acters used to form a symbol may be chosen  from  the  upper
   and  lower case alphabetics, the digits 0-9, and the special






       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 37

       symbols underscore ('_'), dollar  ('$')  and  question  mark
       ('?').  The  first  character  may not be numeric. Upper and
       lower case are distinct. The following  are  all  legal  and
       distinct symbols.

            An_identifier
            an_identifier
            an_identifier1
            $$$
            ?$_123455


            Note that the symbol $  is  special  (representing  the
       current  location)  and  may not be used as a label. Nor may
       any opcode or pseudo-op mnemonic, register name or condition
       code  name.   You  should note the additional condition code
       names described later.

       12.3.1.1. Temporary Labels

            The assembler implements a system of temporary  labels,
       useful  for  use  within  a localized section of code. These
       help eliminate the need to generate names for  labels  which
       are  referenced  only  in  the  immediate  vicinity of their
       definition, for example where a loop is implemented.

            A temporary label takes the form of a digit  string.  A
       reference  to  such  a label requires the same digit string,
       plus an appended b or f to signify  a  backward  or  forward
       reference  respectively.  Here  is  an example of the use of
       such labels.

       entry_point:   ;This is referenced from far away
           ld   b,10
       1:  dec  c
           jr   nz,2f ;if zero, branch forward to 2:
           ld   c,8
           djnz 1b    ;decrement and branch back to 1:
           jr   1f    ;this does not branch to the
                      ;same label as the djnz
       2:  call fred  ;get here from the jr nz,2f
       1:  ret        ;get here from the jr 1f


            The digit string may be any positive decimal  number  0
       to  65535. A temporary label value may be re-used any number
       of times. Where a reference to e.g.  1b is made,  this  will
       reference  the  closest  label 1: found by looking backwards
       from the current point  in  the  file.  Similarly  23f  will
       reference the first label 23: found by looking forwards from
       the current point in the file.

       12.3.2. Constants

            Constants may be entered in one of the radices 2, 8, 10
       or 16. The default is 10. Constants in the other radices may
       be denoted by a trailing character drawn from the  following
       set:






   Page 38                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

                 Character   Radix   Name

                 B           2       binary
                 O           8       octal
                 Q           8       octal
                 o           8       octal
                 q           8       octal
                 H           16      hexadecimal
                 h           16      hexadecimal


        Hexadecimal constants may also be specified in C style,
   for  example LD A,0x21.  Note that a lower case b may not be
   used to indicate a binary number, since  1b  is  a  backward
   reference to a temporary label 1:.

   12.3.2.1. Character Constants

        A character constant is a single character enclosed  in
   single  quotes  (').  Multi  character constants may be used
   only as an operand to a DEFM pseudo-op.

   12.3.2.2. Floating Constants

        A floating constant in the usual notation  (e.g.  1.234
   or 1234e-3) may be used as the operand to a DEFF pseudo-op.

   12.3.2.3. Opcode Constants

        Any z80 opcode may be used as a constant in an  expres-
   sion.  The  value  of the opcode in this context will be the
   byte that the opcode would have assembled to if used in  the
   normal  way. If the opcode is a 2-byte opcode (CB or ED pre-
   fix byte) only the second byte of the opcode will  be  used.
   This  is  particularly  useful when setting up jump vectors.
   For example:

   ld   a,jp         ;a jump instruction
   ld   (0),a        ;0 is jump to warm boot
   ld   hl,boot      ;done here
   ld   (1),hl


   12.3.3. Expressions

        Expressions are constructed largely as described in the
   "Z80 Assembly Language Handbook".

   12.3.3.1. Operators

        The following operators may be used in expressions:

                 Operator   Meaning

                 &          Bitwise AND
                 *          Multiplication

            Operators starting with a dot "." should  be  delimited
       by  spaces,  thus  label .and. 1 is valid but label.and.1 is
       not.

       12.3.3.2. Relocatability

            Zas produces object code  which  is  relocatable;  this
       means  that  it  is  not  necessary to specify assembly time
       where the code is to be located in memory. It is possible to
       do  so,  by  use of the ORG pseudo-op, however the preferred
       approach is to use program sections or psects. A psect is  a
       named  section  of the program, in which code or data may be
       defined at assembly time. All  parts  of  a  psect  will  be
       loaded  contiguously  into memory, even if they were defined
       in separate files, or in the same file but separated by code
       for another psect. For example, the following code will load
       some executable instructions into the psect named text,  and
       some data bytes into the data psect.

























   Page 40                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL


            psect text, global

        alabel:
            ld    hl,astring
            call  putit
            ld    hl,anotherstring

            psect data, global
        astring:
            defm  'A string of chars'
            defb  0
        anotherstring:
            defm  'Another string'
            defb  0

            psect text

        putit:
            ld    a,(hl)
            or    a
            ret   z
            call  outchar
            inc   hl
            jr    putit


        Note that even though the two blocks  of  code  in  the
   text  psect  are separated by a block in the data psect, the
   two text psect blocks will be contiguous when loaded by  the
   linker.  The  instruction  "ld  hl,anotherstring"  will fall
   through to the label "putit:" during execution.  The  actual
   location  in  memory of the two psects will be determined by
   the linker. See the linker manual  for  information  on  how
   psect addresses are determined.

        A label defined in a psect is said to  be  relocatable,
   that  is,  its  actual  memory  address is not determined at
   assembly time. Note that this does not apply if the label is
   in the default (unnamed) psect, or in a psect declared abso-
   lute (see  the  PSECT  pseudo-op  description  below).   Any
   labels  declared in an absolute psect will be absolute, that
   is their address will be determined by the assembler.

        With the version of ZAS  supplied  with  version  7  or
   later  of HI-TECH C, relocatable expressions may be combined
   freely in expressions.  Older versions of ZAS  allowed  only
   limited arithmetic on relocatable expressions.

   12.3.4. Pseudo-ops

        The pseudo-ops are based on those described in the "Z80
   Assembly Language Handbook", with some additions.

   12.3.4.1. DEFB, DB

        This pseudo-op should be followed by a  comma-separated
   list of expressions, which will be assembled into sequential






       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 41

       byte locations. Each expression must have  a  value  between
       -128  and  255  inclusive.   DB can be used as a synonym for
       DEFB.  Example:

           DEFB  10, 20, 'a', 0FFH
           DB    'hello world',13,10,0



       12.3.4.2. DEFF

            This pseudo-op assembles floating point constants  into
       32 bit HI-TECH C format floating point constants.  For exam-
       ple:

       pi: DEFF  3.14159



       12.3.4.3. DEFW

            This operates in a similar fashion to DEFB, except that
       it  assembles expressions into words, without the value res-
       triction.  Example:

           DEFW  -1, 3664H, 'A', 3777Q



       12.3.4.4. DEFS

            Defs reserves  memory  locations  without  initializing
       them.  Its  operand  is an absolute expression, representing
       the number of bytes to  be  reserved.   This  expression  is
       added  to  the  current  location counter. Note however that
       locations reserved by DEFS may be initialized to zero by the
       linker  if  the  reserved locations are in the middle of the
       program.  Example:

           DEFS  20h   ;reserve 32 bytes of memory



       12.3.4.5. EQU

            Equ sets the value of a symbol on the left  of  EQU  to
       the  expression on the right. It is illegal to set the value
       of a symbol which is already defined.  Example:

       SIZE      equ   46



       12.3.4.6. DEFL

            This is identical to EQU except that  it  may  redefine
       existing symbols.  Example:







   Page 42                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL


   SIZE      defl  48



   12.3.4.7. DEFM

        Defm should be followed  by  a  string  of  characters,
   enclosed  in single quotes.  The ASCII values of these char-
   acters  are  assembled  into  successive  memory  locations.
   Example:

       DEFM  'A string of funny *@$ characters'



   12.3.4.8. END

        The end of an assembly is signified by the end  of  the
   source  file,  or  the  END pseudo-op. The END pseudo-op may
   optionally be followed by an expression  which  will  define
   the  start address of the program. This is not actually use-
   ful for CP/M. Only one start address may be defined per pro-
   gram, and the linker will complain if there are more.  Exam-
   ple:

       END   somelabel



   12.3.4.9. COND, IF, ELSE, ENDC

        Conditional assembly is introduced by the COND  pseudo-
   op.  The  operand to COND must be an absolute expression. If
   its value is false (zero) the code following the COND up  to
   the  corresponding  ENDC  pseudo-op  will  not be assembled.
   COND/ENDC pairs may be nested.  IF may be used as a  synonym
   for  COND.  The ELSE pseudo operation may be included within
   a COND/ENDC block, for example:

       IF    CPM
       call  5
       ELSE
       call  os_func
       ENDC



   12.3.4.10. ELSE

        See COND.

   12.3.4.11. ENDC

        See COND.

       12.3.4.12. ENDM

            See MACRO.

       12.3.4.13. PSECT

            This pseudo-op allows specification of relocatable pro-
       gram  sections.  Its  arguments are a psect name, optionally
       followed by a list of psect flags.  The psect name is a sym-
       bol  constructed  according to the same rules as for labels,
       however a psect may have the same name as  a  label  without
       conflict.  Psect  names  are  recognized  only after a PSECT
       pseudo-op.  The psect flags are as follows:

            ABS       Psect is absolute

            GLOBAL    Psect is global

            LOCAL           Psect is not global

            OVRLD     Psect is to be overlapped by linker

            PURE            Psect is to be read-only


            If a psect is global, the linker will merge it with any
       other  global  psects  of  the same name from other modules.
       Local psects will be treated  as  distinct  from  any  other
       psect from another module. Psects are global by default.

            By default the linker concatenates code within a  psect
       from  various modules. If a psect is specified as OVRLD, the
       linker will  overlap  each  module's  contribution  to  that
       psect.  This  is  particularly  useful  when linking modules
       which initialize e.g. interrupt vectors.

            The PURE flag instructs the linker that the psect is to
       be  made  read-only at run time. The usefulness of this flag
       depends on the ability of the linker to enforce the require-
       ment. CP/M fails miserably in this regard.

            The ABS flag makes a psect absolute. The psect will  be
       loaded  at zero.  This is useful for statically initializing
       interrupt vectors and jump tables.  Examples:


            PSECT     text, global, pure
            PSECT     data, global
            PSECT     vectors, ovrld



       12.3.4.14. GLOBAL

            Global should be followed by one  more  symbols  (comma
       separated)  which will be treated by the assembler as global
       symbols, either internal or external  depending  on  whether
       they are defined within the current module or not.  Example:






   Page 44                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL


       GLOBAL      label1, putchar, _printf



   12.3.4.15. ORG

        An ORG pseudo-op sets the current psect to the  default
   (absolute)  psect,  and the location counter to its operand,
   which must be an absolute expression.  Example:

       ORG   100H



   12.3.4.16. MACRO

        This pseudo-op defines a macro.  It  should  be  either
   preceded or followed by the macro name, then optionally fol-
   lowed by a comma-separated list of formal  parameters.   The
   lines  of  code following the MACRO pseudo-op up to the next
   ENDM pseudo-op will be stored as the body of the macro.  The
   macro name may subsequently be used in the opcode part of an
   assembler statement, followed by actual parameters. The text
   of  the body of the macro will be substituted at that point,
   with any use of the formal parameters substituted  with  the
   corresponding actual parameter. For example:

   print     MACRO string
       psect data
   999:      db    string,'$'
       psect text
       ld    de,999b
       ld    c,9
       call  5
       ENDM



        When used, this macro will expand to the 3 instructions
   in the body of the macro, with the actual parameters substi-
   tuted for func and arg. Thus

       print 'hello world'


   expands to

       psect data
   999:      db    'hello world','$'
       psect text
       ld    de,999b
       ld    c,9
       call  5



        Macro arguments can be enclosed in angle brackets  ('<'






       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 45

       and  '>') to pass arbitrary text including delimiter charac-
       ters like commas as a single argument.  For example, suppose
       you  wanted  to use the print macro defined above to print a
       string which includes the carriage return and linefeed char-
       acters.  The macro invocation:

           print 'hello world',13,10


       would fail because 13 and 10 are treated as extra  arguments
       and ignored. In order to pass a string which includes commas
       as a single argument, you could write:

           print <'hello world',13,10>


       which would cause the text 'hello world',13,10 to be  passed
       through as a single argument.  This would expand to the fol-
       lowing code:

           psect data
       999:      db    'hello world',13,10,'$'
           psect text
           ld    de,999b
           ld    c,9
           call  5



            ZAS supports two forms of macro declaration for  compa-
       tibility  with  older  versions  of ZAS and other Z80 assem-
       blers.  The macro name may be declared either in  the  label
       field  before  the  MACRO pseudo-op, or in the operand field
       after the MACRO pseudo-op.  Thus these  two  MACRO  declara-
       tions are equivalent:

       bdos      MACRO func,arg
           ld    de,arg
           ld    c,func
           call  5
           ENDM

       and

           MACRO bdos,func,arg
           ld    de,arg
           ld    c,func
           call  5
           ENDM



       12.3.4.17. LOCAL

            The LOCAL pseudo-op allows unique labels to be  defined
       for each expansion of a macro.  Any symbols listed after the
       LOCAL directive will have a unique assembler-generated  sym-
       bol  substituted  for  them when the macro is expanded.  For






   Page 46                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   example:

   copy      MACRO source,dest,count
       LOCAL nocopy
       push  af
       push  bc
       ld    bc,source
       ld    a,b
       or    c
       jr    z,nocopy
       push  de
       push  hl
       ld    de,dest
       ld    hl,source
       ldir
       pop   hl
       pop   de
   nocopy:   pop   bc
       pop   af
       ENDM


   when expanded will  include  a  unique  assembler  generated
   label    in    place   of   nocopy.    For   example,   copy
   (recptr),buf,(recsize) will expand to:

       push  af
       push  bc
       ld    bc,(recsize)
       ld    a,b
       or    c
       jr    z,??0001
       push  de
       push  hl
       ld    de,buf
       ld    hl,(recptr)
       ldir
       pop   hl
       pop   de
   ??0001:   pop   bc
       pop   af

   if invoked a second time, the label nocopy would  expand  to
   ??0002.

   12.3.4.18. REPT

        The REPT pseudo-op defines a temporary macro  which  is
   then  expanded a number of times, as determined by its argu-
   ment.  For example:

       REPT  3
       ld    (hl),0
       inc   hl
       ENDM


   will expand to






       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 47


           ld    (hl),0
           inc   hl
           ld    (hl),0
           inc   hl
           ld    (hl),0
           inc   hl



       12.3.5. IRP and IRPC

            The IRP and IRPC directives are similar to  REPT,  how-
       ever  instead of repeating the block a fixed number of times
       it is repeated once for each member of an argument list.  In
       the  case  of  IRP the list is a conventional macro argument
       list, in the case of IRPC it is successive characters from a
       string.  For example:

           IRP   string,<'hello world',13,10>,'arg2'
           LOCAL str
           psect data
       str:      db    string,'$'
           psect text
           ld    c,9
           ld    de,str
           call  5
           ENDM


       would expand to

           psect data
       ??0001:   db    'hello world',13,10,'$'
           psect text
           ld    c,9
           ld    de,??0001
           call  5
           psect data
       ??0002:   db    'arg2','$'
           psect text
           ld    c,9
           ld    de,??0002
           call  5


       Note the use of LOCAL labels and angle brackets in the  same
       manner as with conventional macros.

            IRPC is best demonstrated using the following example:

           IRPC  char,ABC
           ld    c,2
           ld    e,'char'
           call  5
           ENDM

   12.3.6. Extended Condition Codes

        The assembler recognizes several  additional  condition
   codes. These are:

        _________________________________________________
       | Code|  Equivalent|  Meaning                    |
       | alt |  m         |  Arithmetic less than       |
       | llt |  c         |  Logical less than          |
       | age |  p         |  Arithmetic greater or equal|
       | lge |  nc        |  Logical greater or equal   |

   12.4. Assembler Directives

        An assembler directive is a line  in  the  source  file
   which  produces  no  code,  but  rather  which  modifies the
   behaviour of the assembler. Each directive is recognized  by
   the presence of an asterisk in the first column of the line,
   followed immediately by a word, only the first character  of
   which is looked at. the line containing the directive itself
   is never listed.  The directives are:

   *Title
        Use the text following the directive as a title for the
        listing.

   *Heading
        Use the text following the directive as a subtitle  for
        the listing; also causes an *Eject.

   *List
        May be followed by ON or OFF to turn listing on or  off
        respectively.  Note  that  this  directive  may be used
        inside a macro or include file to  control  listing  of
        that macro or include file.  The previous listing state
        will be restored on exit  from  the  macro  or  include
        file.








       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 49

       *Include
            The file named following the directive will be included
            in the assembly at that point.

       *Eject
            A new page will be  started  in  the  listing  at  that
            point.  A  form  feed character in the source will have
            the same effect.

            Some examples of the use of these directives:


            *Title Widget Control Program
            *Heading Initialization Phase

            *Include widget.i



       12.5. Diagnostics

            An error message will be written on the standard  error
       stream for each error encountered in the assembly. This mes-
       sage identifies the file name and line number and  describes
       the  error.  In  addition  the line in the listing where the
       error occurred will be flagged with a  single  character  to
       indicate  the  error.  The  characters and the corresponding
       messages are:

   12.6. Z80/Z180/64180 Instruction Set

        The remainder of this chapter is devoted to a  complete
   instruction  set listing for the Z80, Z180, 64180 and NSC800
   processors.   The  Z180  and  64180  will  execute  all  Z80
   instructions, although the timing is different.

       13. Linker Reference Manual


            HI-TECH  C  incorporates  a  relocating  assembler  and
       linker  to  permit  separate  compilation of C source files.
       This means that a program may be divided into several source
       files,  each  of  which may be kept to a manageable size for
       ease of editing and compilation, then each object file  com-
       piled  separately  and  finally  all the object files linked
       together into a single executable program.

            The assembler  is  described  in  the  machine-specific
       manual.   This  appendix describes the theory behind and the
       usage of the linker.

       13.1. Relocation and Psects

            The fundamental  task  of  the  linker  is  to  combine
       several  relocatable object files into one. The object files
       are said to be relocatable since the files  have  sufficient
       information  in  them  so  that any references to program or
       data addresses (e.g. the address of a function)  within  the
       file  may  be  adjusted according to where the file is ulti-
       mately located in memory after the linkage process. Thus the
       file  is  said  to  be  relocatable. Relocation may take two
       basic forms; relocation by  name,  i.e.  relocation  by  the
       ultimate  value  of a global symbol, or relocation by psect,
       i.e. relocation by the base address of a particular  section
       of  code,  for  example  the  section of code containing the
       actual excutable instructions.

       13.1.1. Program Sections

            Any object file may  contain  bytes  to  be  stored  in
       memory  in  one  or  more  program  sections,  which will be
       referred to as psects. These psects represent logical group-
       ings  of  certain  types  of code bytes in the program.  The
       section of the program containing executable instructions is
       normally  referred  to as the text psect. Other sections are
       the initialized data psect, called simply  the  data  psect,
       and the uninitialized data psect, called the bss psect.

            In fact the linker will handle any  number  of  psects,
       and  in  fact more may be used in special applications. How-
       ever the C compiler uses only the three mentioned,  and  the
       names  text,  data and bss are simply chosen for identifica-
       tion; the linker assigns no special significance to the name
       of a psect.

            The difference between the data and bss psects  may  be
       exemplified  by  considering  two external variables; one is
       initialized to the value 1, and the other  is  not  initial-
       ized.  The first will be placed into the data psect, and the
       second in the bss psect. The bss psect is always cleared  to
       zeros  on  startup  of the program, thus the second variable
       will be initialized at run time to zero. The first will how-
       ever occupy space in the program file, and will maintain its






   Page 70                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   initialized value of 1 at startup. It is quite  possible  to
   modify the value of a variable in the data psect during exe-
   cution, however it is better practice not to  do  so,  since
   this  leads  to more consistent use of variables, and allows
   for restartable and romable programs.

        The text psect is the section into which all executable
   instructions are placed. On CP/M-80 the text psect will nor-
   mally start at the base of the TPA, which is where execution
   commences.  The  data  psect  will  normally follow the text
   psect, and the bss will be last. The  bss  does  not  occupy
   space  in  the  program (.COM) file. This ordering of psects
   may be overridden by an option to the linker. This is  espe-
   cially useful when producing code for special hardware.

        For MS-DOS and CP/M-86 the psects are  ordered  in  the
   same way, but since the 8086 processor has segment registers
   providing relocation, both the text and data psects start at
   0,  even  though  they will be loaded one after the other in
   memory. This allows 64k code and 64k data and stack.  Suffi-
   cient  information is placed in the executable file (.EXE or
   .CMD) for the  operating  system  to  load  the  program  in
   memory.

   13.1.2. Local Psects and the Large Model

        Since for practical purposes the psects are limited  to
   64K  on  the  8086, to allow more than 64K code the compiler
   makes use of local psects. A psect is  considered  local  if
   the  .psect  directive has a LOCAL flag. Any number of local
   psects may be linked from different  modules  without  being
   combined  even if they have the same name. Note however that
   no local psect may have the same name as a global psect.

        All references to a local psect within the same  module
   (or  within  the same library) will be treated as references
   to the same psect. Between modules however two local  psects
   of the same name are treated as distinct.  In order to allow
   collective referencing of local psects  via  the  -P  option
   (described  later) a local psect may have a class name asso-
   ciated with it. This is achieved witht the _C_L_A_S_S flag on the
   .psect directive.

   13.2. Global Symbols

        The  linker  handles  only  symbols  which  have   been
   declared  as  global  to  the  assembler.  From the C source
   level, this means all names which have storage class  exter-
   nal  and which are not declared as static. These symbols may
   be referred to by modules other than the one in  which  they
   are  defined. It is the linker's job to match up the defini-
   tion of a global symbol with the references to it.

       13.3. Operation

            A command to the linker takes the following form:

            LINK options files ...


            Options is zero or more linker options, each  of  which
       modifies  the  behaviour of the linker in some way. Files is
       one or more object files, and zero or  more  library  names.
       The  options  recognized  by the linker are as follows: they
       will be recognized in upper or lower case.

       -R   Leave the output relocatable.

       -L   Retain absolute relocation info. -LM will  retain  only
            segement relocation information.

       -I   Ignore undefined symbols.

       -N   Sort symbols by address.

       -Caddr
            Produce a binary output file offset by addr.

       -S   Strip symbol information from the output file.

       -X   Suppress local symbols in the output file.

       -Z   Suppress trivial (compiler-generated)  symbols  in  the
            output file.

       -Oname
            Call the output file name.

       -Pspec
            Spec is a psect location specification.

       -Mname
            Write a link map to the file name.

       -Usymbol
            Make symbol initially undefined.

       -Dfile
            Write a symbol file.

       -Wwidth
            Specify map width.

            Taking each of these in turn:

            The -R option will instruct the  linker  to  leave  the
       output  file  (as named by a -O option, or l.obj by default)
       relocatable. This is  normally  because  there  are  further
       files  to  be linked in, and the output of this link will be
       used as input  to  the  linker  subsequently.  Without  this
       option,  the linker will make the output file absolute, that






   Page 72                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   is with all relocatable addresses made into absolute  refer-
   ences.   This  option  may  not  be  used  with the -L or -C
   options.

        The -L option will cause  the  linker  to  output  null
   relocation  information  even  though the file will be abso-
   lute. This information allows  self-relocating  programs  to
   know  what  addresses  must  be  relocated at run time. This
   option is not usable with the -C option. In order to  create
   an  executable  file (i.e. a .COM file) the program objtohex
   must be used.  If a -LM option is used, only segment reloca-
   tion  information will be retained.  This is used in conjuc-
   tion with the large memory  model.  Objtohex  will  use  the
   relocation  information  (when  invoked  with  a -L flag) to
   insert segment  relocation  addresses  into  the  executable
   file.

        The -I option is used when it is desired to  link  code
   which  contains symbols which are not defined in any module.
   This is normally only used during top-down program  develop-
   ment,  when  routines  are referenced in code written before
   the routines themselves have been coded.

        When obtaining a link map via the -M option, the symbol
   table  is by default sorted in order of symbol name. To sort
   in order of address, the -N option may be used.

        The output of the linker is by default an object  file.
   To create an executable program, this must be converted into
   an executable image. For CP/M this is a .COM file, which  is
   simply  an  image  of  the  executable  program as it should
   appear in memory, starting at location 100H. The linker will
   produce such a file with the -C100H option. File formats for
   other applications requiring an image binary file  may  also
   be  produced  with the -C option.  The address following the
   -C may be given in decimal (default), octal (by using o or O
   suffix) or hexadecimal (by using an h or H suffix).

        Note that because of the complexity of  the  executable
   file  formats  for MS-DOS and CP/M-86, LINK will not produce
   these (.EXE and .CMD resp.) formats directly.  The  compiler
   automatically runs OBJTOHEX with appropriate options to gen-
   erate the correct file format.

        The -S, -X and -Z options, which are  meaningless  when
   the  -C option is used, will strip respectively all symbols,
   all local symbols or all trivial local symbols from the out-
   put  file.  Trivial symbols are symbols produced by the com-
   piler, and have the form of one of a set of alphabetic char-
   acters followed by a digit string.

        The default output file name is _l._o_b_j,  or  _l._b_i_n  when
   the -C option is used.  This may be overridden by the -O_n_a_m_e
   option.  The  output  file  will  be  called  _n_a_m_e  in  this
   instance.  Note  that no suffix is appended to the name; the
   file will be called exactly the argument to the option.

        For certain specialized  applications,  e.g.  producing






       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 73

       code  for  an  embedded  microprocessor,  it is necessary to
       specify to the linker at what  address  the  various  psects
       should  be located. This is accomplished with the -P option.
       It is followed by a specification  consisting  of  a  comma-
       separated list of psect names, each with an optional address
       specification. In the absence of  an  address  specification
       for  a psect listed, it will be concatenated with the previ-
       ous psect. For example

            -Ptext=0c000h,data,bss=8000h


            This will cause the text psect to be located at 0C000H,
       the  data  psect  to start at the end of the text psect, and
       the bss psect to start at 8000H. This may be for a processor
       with ROM at 0C000H and RAM at 8000H.

            Where the link address, that is the  address  at  which
       the  code  will be addressed at execution time, and the load
       address, that is the address offset within the output  file,
       are  different  (e.g for the 8086) it is possible to specify
       the load address separately from the link address. For exam-
       ple:

            -Ptext=100h/0,data=0C000h/


            This specification will cause the text  segment  to  be
       linked  for execution at 100h, but loaded in the output file
       at 0, while the data segment will be linked for 0C000h,  but
       loaded  contiguously  with the text psect in the file.  Note
       that if the slash (`/') is omitted, the load address is  the
       same  as  the  link address, while if the slash is supplied,
       but not followed by an address, the  psect  will  be  loaded
       after the previous psect.

            In order to specify link and load addresses  for  local
       psects,  the  group  name  to which the psects belong may be
       used in place of a global psect name. The local psects  will
       then  have a link address as specified in the -P option, and
       load addresses incrementing upwards from the specified  load
       address.

            The -Mname option requests a link map, containing  sym-
       bol  table and module load address information to be written
       onto the file name. If name is  omitted,  the  map  will  be
       written  to  standard  output. -W may be used to specify the
       desired width of the map.

            The -U option allows the specification to the linker of
       a  symbol  which  is to be initially entered into the symbol
       table as undefined. This is  useful  when  loading  entirely
       from libraries. More than one -U flag may be used.

            If it is desired to use the  debugger  on  the  program
       being  linked,  it  is  useful to produce a symbol file. The
       -D_f_i_l_e option will write such a symbol file onto  the  named
       _f_i_l_e, or _l._s_y_m if no file is given. The symbol file consists






   Page 74                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   of a list of addresses and symbols, one per line.

   13.4. Examples

        Here are some examples of using the linker.  Note  how-
   ever  that  in the normal case it is not necessary to invoke
   the linker explicitly, since it is invoked automatically  by
   the C command.

   LINK -MMAP -C100H START.OBJ MAIN.OBJ A:LIBC.LIB


        This command links the  files  start.obj  and  main.obj
   with  the  library  a:libc.lib.  Only those modules that are
   required from the library will be in  fact  linked  in.  The
   output  is  to be in .COM format, placed in the default file
   l.bin. A map is to be written to the file of the  name  map.
   Note  that  the  file start.obj should contain startup code,
   and in fact the lowest address code in  that  file  will  be
   executed when the program is run, since it will be at 100H.

        LINK -X -R -OX.OBJ FILE1.OBJ FILE2.OBJ A:LIBC.LIB


        The files file1.obj and file2.obj will be  linked  with
   any  necessary routines from a:libc.lib and left in the file
   x.obj.  This file will remain relocatable. Undefined symbols
   will not cause an error.  The file x.obj will probably later
   be the object of another link invocation.  All local symbols
   will be stripped from the output file, thus saving space.

   13.5. Invoking the Linker

        The linker is called LINK, and normally resides on  the
   A:  drive,  under CP/M, or in the directory A:\HITECH\ under
   MS-DOS. It may be invoked with no arguments, in  which  case
   it  will  prompt for input from standard input. If the stan-
   dard input is a file, no prompts will be printed.  The input
   supplied in this manner may contain lower case, whereas CP/M
   converts the entire command line to upper case  by  default.
   This  is useful with the -U  and -P options.  This manner of
   invocation is generally useful if the number of arguments to
   LINK  is large. Even if the list of files is too long to fit
   on one line, continuation lines may be included by leaving a
   backslash  ('\')  at  the end of the preceding line. In this
   fashion, LINK commands of almost  unlimited  length  may  be
   issued.

       14. Librarian


            The librarian program, LIBR, has the function  of  com-
       bining  several  object  files into a single file known as a
       library. The  purposes  of  combining  several  such  object
       modules are several.

            a.   fewer files to link
            b.   faster access
            c.   uses less disk space


            In order to make the  library  concept  useful,  it  is
       necessary  for the linker to treat modules in a library dif-
       ferently from object files. If an object file  is  specified
       to  the  linker,  it  will  be  linked into the final linked
       module. A module in a library, however, will only be  linked
       in  if  it defines one or more symbols previously known, but
       not defined, to the linker. Thus modules in a  library  will
       be  linked  only if required. Since the choice of modules to
       link is made on the  first  pass  of  the  linker,  and  the
       library  is  searched in a linear fashion, it is possible to
       order the modules in a library to  produce  special  effects
       when linking.  More will be said about this later.

       14.1. The Library Format

            The modules  in  a  library  are  basically  just  con-
       catenated, but at the beginning of a library is maintained a
       directory of the modules and symbols in the  library.  Since
       this  directory  is smaller than the sum of the modules, the
       linker is speeded up when searching a library since it  need
       read only the directory and not all the modules on the first
       pass. On the second pass it need  read  only  those  modules
       which are required, seeking over the others. This all minim-
       izes disk i/o when linking.

            It should be noted that the library  format  is  geared
       exclusively toward object modules, and is not a general pur-
       pose archiving mechanism as is used by some  other  compiler
       systems.  This  has  the  advantage  that  the format may be
       optimized toward speeding up the linkage process.

       14.2. Using

            The librarian program is called LIBR, and the format of
       commands to it is as follows:

            LIBR k file.lib file.obj ...


            Interpreting this, LIBR is the name of the  program,  k
       is  a  key  letter  denoting  the  function requested of the
       librarian (replacing, extracting or deleting modules,  list-
       ing modules or symbols), file.lib is the name of the library
       file to be operated on, and file.obj is zero or more  object






   Page 76                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   file names.

        The key letters are:

        r       replace modules
        d       delete modules
        x       extract modules
        m       list module names
        s       list modules with symbols


        When replacing  or  extracting  modules,  the  file.obj
   arguments  are  the  names  of the modules to be replaced or
   extracted. If  no  such  arguments  are  supplied,  all  the
   modules in the library will be replaced or extracted respec-
   tively.  Adding a file to a library is performed by request-
   ing  the librarian to replace it in the library. Since it is
   not present, the module will be appended to the library.  If
   the r key is used and the library does not exist, it will be
   created.

        Under the d keyletter, the named object files  will  be
   deleted  from the library.  In this instance, it is an error
   not to give any object file names.

        The m and s keyletters will list the named modules and,
   in  the  case  of  the  s  keyletter, the symbols defined or
   referenced within (global symbols only are  handled  by  the
   librarian). As with the r and x keyletters, an empty list of
   modules means all the modules in the library.

   14.3. Examples

        Here are some examples of usage of the librarian.

   LIBR m file.lib
        List all modules in the library file.lib.

   LIBR s file.lib a.obj b.obj c.obj
        List the global symbols in the modules a.obj, b.obj and
        c.obj

   LIBR r file.lib 1.obj 2.obj
        Replace the module 1.obj in the file file.lib with  the
        contents  of  the  object  file  1.obj,  and repeat for
        2.obj. If the object module is not already  present  in
        the library, append it to the end.

   LIBR x file.lib
        Extract, without deletion, all the modules in  file.lib
        and write them as object files on disk.

   LIBR d file.lib a.obj b.obj 2.obj
        Delete the object modules a.obj, b.obj and  2.obj  from
        the library file.lib.

       14.4. Supplying Arguments

            Since it is often necessary to supply many object  file
       arguments  to  LIBR, and command lines are restricted to 127
       characters by CP/M and MS-DOS,  LIBR  will  accept  commands
       from  standard input if no command line arguments are given.
       If the standard input is attached to the console, LIBR  will
       prompt.  Multiple  line  input  may  be  given  by  using  a
       backslash as a continuation character on the end of a  line.
       If  standard input is redirected from a file, LIBR will take
       input from the file, without prompting. For example:

            LIBR
            libr> r file.lib 1.obj 2.obj 3.obj \
            libr> 4.obj 5.obj 6.obj

       will perform much the same as if the  .obj  files  had  been
       typed on the command line. The libr> prompts were printed by
       LIBR itself, the remainder of the text was typed as input.

            LIBR <lib.cmd


            Libr will read input from lib.cmd, and execute the com-
       mand found therein. This allows a virtually unlimited length
       command to be given to LIBR.

       14.5. Listing Format

            A request to LIBR to list module names will simply pro-
       duce  a list of names, one per line, on standard output. The
       s keyletter will produce the same, with a  list  of  symbols
       after  each module name. Each symbol will be preceded by the
       letter D or U, representing a definition or reference to the
       symbol  respectively. The -W option may be used to determine
       the width of the paper for this operation. For example  LIBR
       -w80 s file.lib will list all modules in file.lib with their
       global symbols, with the output formatted for an  80  column
       printer or display.

       14.6. Ordering of Libraries

            The librarian creates libraries with the modules in the
       order  in  which  they  were given on the command line. When
       updating a library the order of the  modules  is  preserved.
       Any new modules added to a library after it has been created
       will be appended to the end.

            The ordering of the modules in a library is significant
       to  the  linker. If a library contains a module which refer-
       ences a  symbol  defined  in  another  module  in  the  same
       library,  the  module  defining the symbol should come after
       the module referencing the symbol.

   14.7. Error Messages

        Libr issues  various  error  messages,  most  of  which
   represent  a  fatal  error,  while some represent a harmless
   occurence which will nonetheless be reported unless  the  -w
   option  was  used. In this case all warning messages will be
   suppressed.

       15. Objtohex


            The HI-TECH  linker  is  capable  of  producing  simple
       binary  files,  or  object files as output. Any other format
       required must be produced by  running  the  utility  program
       OBJTOHEX.   This  allows  conversion of object files as pro-
       duced by the linker into a  variety  of  different  formats,
       including various hex formats. The program is invoked thus:

            OBJTOHEX options inputfile outputfile


            All of the arguments are  optional.  If  outputfile  is
       ommitted  it defaults to l.hex or l.bin depending on whether
       the -b option is used. The inputfile defaults to l.obj.

            The options are:

       -B_a_d_d_r
            Produce a binary image output. This is similar  to  the
            -C  option  of  the  linker.   If addr is supplied, the
            start of the image file will be offset by addr. If addr
            is  omitted,  the  first  byte  in the file will be the
            lowest byte initialized. Addr may be given in  decimal,
            octal or hexadecimal. The default radix is decimal, and
            suffix letters of o or O indicate octal,  and  h  or  H
            indicate  hex.  Thus -B100H will produce a file in .COM
            format.

       -I   Include symbol records in the Intel format hex  output.
            Each  symbol  record  has  a  form similar to an object
            record, but with a  different  record  type.  The  data
            bytes  in  the  record  are  the  symbol  name, and the
            address is the value of the symbol.  This is useful for
            downloading to ROM debuggers.

       -C   Read a checksum specification from the standard  input.
            The  checksum  specification  is described below. Typi-
            cally the specification will be in a file.

       -E_s_t_a_c_k
            This option produces an MS-DOS .EXE  format  file.  The
            optional  stack  argument  will  determine  the maximum
            stack size the program will be allocated on  execution.
            By  default  the  program will be allocated the maximum
            stack available, up to the limit  of  64K  data.  If  a
            stack  argument  is  supplied,  the stack size will not
            exceed the argument. This is useful to limit the amount
            of  memory a program will use. The stack argument takes
            the same form as the argument to -B above.

       -8_s_t_a_c_k
            This option will produce a CP/M-86 .CMD file. The stack
            argument is the same as for the -E option.








   Page 80                              HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL

   -A_s_t_a_c_k
        This is used when producing a.out format files for unix
        systems  (specifically Venix-86). If the stack argument
        is zero, the size of the data segment will be 64k, oth-
        erwise the stack will be placed below the data segment,
        and its size set to stack.  This must  be  co-ordinated
        with  appropriate  arguments  to  the  -p option of the
        linker.

   -M   This flag will instruct objtohex  to  produce  Motorola
        'S' format hex output.

   -L   This option is used when  producing  large  model  pro-
        grams;  the  linker  will  have  been used with the -LM
        option to retain segment relocation information in  the
        object  file.  Use  of  the  -L option to objtohex will
        cause it to convert that segment relocation information
        into  appropriate  data  in the executable file for use
        when the program is loaded. Either the operating system
        or  the  run-time  startup code will use the relocation
        data to adjust segment references  based  on  where  in
        memory  the  program  is  actually  loaded.   If the -L
        option is followed by a symbol name, then  the  reloca-
        tion   information   will  be  stored  at  the  address
        represented by that symbol in  the  output  file,  e.g.
        -L___B_b_s_s  will cause it to be stored at the base of the
        bss psect (___B_b_s_s is defined by the linker  to  be  the
        load  address  of the bss psect). If the special symbol
        _D_o_s__h_d_r is used then the relocation information will be
        stored  in the .EXE file header.  This is only valid in
        conjunction with the -E option.

   -S   The -S option instructs  objtohex  to  write  a  symbol
        file.  The symbol file name is given after the -S, e.g.
        -S_x_x._s_y_m.

        Unless  another  format  is   specifically   requested,
   objtohex  will  produce  a file in Intel hex format. This is
   suitable for down-line loading, PROM programming  etc.   The
   HP  format is useful for transferring code to an HP64000 for
   emulation or PROM programming.

        The checksum specification  allows  automated  checksum
   calculation.  The  checksum  specification takes the form of
   several lines, each line describing one checksum. The syntax
   of a checksum line is:

        addr1-addr2 where1-where2 +offset


        All of addr1, addr2, where1, where2 and offset are  hex
   numbers,  without  the  usual H suffix. Such a specification
   says that the bytes at  addr1  through  to  addr2  inclusive
   should  be summed and the sum placed in the locations where1
   through where2 inclusive. For an 8 bit  checksum  these  two
   addresses should be the same. For a checksum stored low byte
   first, where1 should be less than where2,  and  vice  versa.
   The  +offset  is optional, but if supplied, the value offset






       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                              Page 81

       will be used to initialize the  checksum.  Otherwise  it  is
       initialized to zero. For example:

            0005-1FFF 3-4 +1FFF


            This will sum the bytes in 5 through  1FFFH  inclusive,
       then  add  1FFFH  to  the  sum.  The 16 bit checksum will be
       placed in locations 3 and 4, low byte in 3. The checksum  is
       initialized  with 1FFFH to provide protection against an all
       zero rom, or a rom misplaced in memory. A run time check  of
       this  checksum  would  add the last address of the rom being
       checksummed into the checksum. For the rom in question, this
       should  be 1FFFH.  The initialization value may, however, be
       used in any desired fashion.

       16. Cref


            The cross reference list utility CREF is used to format
       raw  cross-reference information produced by the compiler or
       the assembler into a sorted listing.  A raw  cross-reference
       file  is  produced  with the -CR option to the compiler. The
       assembler will generate a raw cross-reference file with a -C
       option  (Z80  or  8086  assemblers)  or  by using an OPT CRE
       directive (6800 series assemblers) or  a  REF  control  line
       (8096 assembler)..  The general form of the CREF command is:

            CREF options files

       where _o_p_t_i_o_n_s is zero or more options as described below and
       _f_i_l_e_s  is one or more raw cross-reference files.  CREF takes
       the following options:

       -O_o_u_t_f_i_l_e
            Allows  specification  of  the  output  file  name.  By
            default  the  listing  will  be written to the standard
            output and may  be  redirected  in  the  usual  manner.
            Alternatively  using  the -O option an output file name
            may be specified, e.g. -O_x_x_x._l_s_t.

       -P_w_i_d_t_h
            This option allows the specification of  the  width  to
            which  the  listing is to be formatted, e.g. -P_1_3_2 will
            format the  listing  for  a  132  column  printer.  The
            default is 80 columns.

       -L_l_e_n_g_t_h
            Specify the length of the paper on which the listing is
            to  be  produced, e.g.  if the listing is to be printed
            on 55 line paper you  would  use  a  -L_5_5  option.  The
            default is 66 lines.

       -X_p_r_e_f_i_x
            The -X option allows the exclusion of symbols from  the
            listing, based on a prefix given as argument to -X. For
            example if it was desired to exclude all symbols start-
            ing  with  the  character  sequence _x_y_z then the option
            -X_x_y_z would be used. If a digit appears in the  charac-
            ter sequence then this will match any digit in the sym-
            bol, e.g. -XX0 would exclude any symbols starting  with
            the letter _X followed by a digit.

       -F   -F will exclude from the listing  any  references  from
            files  with  a  full  path name. A full path name means
            either: a file name starting  with  a  slash  ('/')  or
            backslash  ('\')  or  a  file name starting with a CP/M
            user number/drive letter prefix,  e.g.  0:A:.  This  is
            intended to force omission from the listing of any sym-
            bol references derived from standard header files, e.g.
            using -F would omit any references from the header file
            STDIO.H.

   -H_s_t_r_i_n_g
        The -H option takes a string as an argument which  will
        be used as a header in the listing. The default heading
        is the name of the first raw cross-ref information file
        specified.

   -S_s_t_o_p_l_i_s_t
        The -S option should have as its argument the name of a
        file  containing  a list of symbols not to be listed in
        the cross-reference. Multiple stoplists may be supplied
        with multiple -S options.

        Cref will accept wild card filenames and  I/O  redirec-
   tion.  Long  command  lines may be supplied by invoking CREF
   with no arguments and typing the command line in response to
   the _c_r_e_f> prompt. A backslash at the end of the line will be
   interpreted to mean that more command lines follow.

        the space, e.g. a relocated one  byte  address  exceeds
        256 or a relocated 16 bit address exceeds 65536

   float param coerced to double      P1
        This float parameter has been converted to double  -  a
        prototype will override this coercion

   function() declared implicit int      P1
        This function  has  been  called  without  an  explicit
        declaration. It is wise to explicitly declare all func-
        tions, preferably with a  prototype.  This  will  avoid
        many potential errors where your program comprises more
        than one source file

   function does not take arguments      P1
        The prototype for this function indicates it  takes  no
        arguments

   function or function pointer required      P1
        A  function  identifier  or  pointer  to  function   is
        required for a function call.

   functions can't return arrays      P1
        A function cannot return an array -  it  can  return  a
        pointer

   functions can't return functions      P1
        A function cannot return a function - it can  return  a

   hex digit expected      P1
        A hex digit is expected after '0x'

   identifier is a structure tag      P1
        A structure tag  has  been  used  in  a  context  where
        another  kind  of  tag  is expected, e.g. saying struct
        fred where fred has previously been declared  as  union
        fred.

   identifier is a union tag      P1
        Similar to the above error

   identifier is an enum tag      P1
        Similar to the above error

   identifier: large offset      CGEN
        Z80 only: This identifier has a large offset  from  the
        stack  frame and thus access to it is inefficient. In a
        function any arrays should be declared after any simple
        variables

            A # directive passed through to the first pass is  unk-
            nown.  If  this occurs with a #include it may be caused
            by a previous include file not  having  a  <CR><LF>  or
            newline on the last line.

                          Standard Library Functions



            The functions accessible to user programs in the  stan-
       dard  library  libc.lib are listed below, by category with a
       short comment, then alphabetically with  a  longer  descrip-
       tion.  In  the  detailed  description  of each function, the
       SYNOPSIS section  describes  the  function  in  roughly  the
       manner in which the function would be declared in the source
       file defining it.  Where an  include  file  is  shown,  this
       implies  that  that  include  file  must  be included in any
       source file using that function.

            Where an include file is not provided, it will normally
       be necessary for an extern declaration of the function to be
       included in any source module using it, to ensure  that  the
       type  of the function is correct.  For example, if the func-
       tion _l_s_e_e_k() was to be used, a declaration of the form

       should be in either the source file  itself  or  an  include
       file included in the source file. This ensures that the com-
       piler knows that _l_s_e_e_k() returns a long value  and  not  the
       default int.

            Where reference is made to STDIO, this means the  group
       of functions under the heading STANDARD I/O below. These all
       have one thing in common; they  operate  on  pointers  to  a
       defined  data  type  called  FILE.  Such  a pointer is often
       referred to as a _s_t_r_e_a_m pointer. The concept of a stream  is
       central  to these routines. Essentially a stream is a source
       or sink of data bytes. To the operating system  and  library
       routines  this  stream is featureless, i.e. no record struc-
       ture is implied or assumed. Some routines do however  recog-
       nize end of line characters.

                         ACOS, ASIN, ATAN, ATAN2
       SYNOPSIS

            #include  <math.h>

            double    acos(double f)
            double    asin(double f)
            double    atan(double f)

            double    atan2(double x, double y)


       DESCRIPTION
            These functions are the converse  of  the  trignometric
            functions cos, sin and tan. Acos and asin are undefined
            for arguments whose absolute value is greater than 1.0.
            The  returned  value  is  in radians, and always in the
            range -pi/2 to +pi/2, except for _c_o_s(), which returns a
            value  in  the  range  0  to  pi.   _A_t_a_n_2() returns the
            inverse tan of x/y but uses the signs of its  arguments
            to return a value in the range -pi to +pi.

   SYNOPSIS

   DESCRIPTION
        The _a_t_e_x_i_t() function registers the function pointed to
        by  func, to be called without arguments at normal pro-
        gram termination.  _A_t_e_i_x_t() returns zero if the  regis-
        tration succeeds, nonzero if it fails.  On program ter-
        mination, all  functions  registered  by  _a_t_e_x_i_t()  are
        called, in the reverse order of their registration.

   DESCRIPTION
        _A_s_c_t_i_m_e() takes the broken down time pointed to by  its
        argument,  and returns a 26 character string describing
        the current date and time in the format

             Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973\n\0

        Note the newline at the end of the string. The width of
        each field in the string is fixed.

                                  ASSERT
       SYNOPSIS

            #include  <assert.h>

            void      assert(int e)


       DESCRIPTION
            This macro is used for debugging  purposes;  the  basic
            method  of  usage  is  to  place  assertions  liberally
            throughout your code at points where correct  operation
            of  the code depends upon certain conditions being true
            initially. An _a_s_s_e_r_t() may be used  to  ensure  at  run
            time  that that assumption holds. For example, the fol-
            lowing statement asserts that the pointer  tp  is  non-
            null:

                 assert(tp);

            If at run time the expression evaluates to  false,  the
            program  will  abort  with  a  message  identifying the
            source file and line number of the assertion,  and  the
            expression  used as an argument to it. A fuller discus-
            sion of the uses of assert  is  impossible  in  limited
            space,  but  it is closely linked to methods of proving
            program correctness.

            These routines convert a decimal number in the argument
            string  s  into a double float, integer or long integer
            respectively. Leading blanks are skipped over.  In  the
            case  of  _a_t_o_f(), the number may be in scientific nota-
            tion.

                         BDOS (CP/M only)
   SYNOPSIS

        #include  <cpm.h>

        char      bdos(int func, int arg)

        short bdoshl(int func, int arg)(CP/M-80 only)


   DESCRIPTION
        _B_d_o_s() calls the CP/M BDOS with func in register C  (CL
        for  CP/M-86)  and  arg in register DE (DX). The return
        value is the byte returned by the BDOS  in  register  A
        (AX).   _B_d_o_s_h_l()  is  the  same, except that the return
        value is the value returned by the BDOS  in  HL.   Con-
        stant  values  for the various BDOS function values are
        defined in cpm.h.

        These functions should be avoided  except  in  programs
        which  are not intended to be used on an operating sys-
        tem other than CP/M. The standard I/O routines  are  to
        be preferred, since they are portable.

                         BIOS (CP/M only)
   SYNOPSIS

        #includ   <cpm.h>

        char bios(int n, int a1, int a2)


   DESCRIPTION
        This function will call the n'th bios entry point (cold
        boot  =  0,  warm boot = 1, etc.) with register BC (CX)
        set to the argument a1 and DE (DX) set to the  argument
        a2. The return value is the contents of register A (AX)
        after the bios call. On CP/M-86, bdos  function  50  is
        used  to  perform  the bios call.  This function should
        not be used unless  unavoidable,  since  it  is  highly
        non-portable. There is even no guarantee of portability
        of bios calls between differing CP/M systems.

       SYNOPSIS

            #include  <stdlib.h>

            char * calloc(size_t cnt, size_t size)


       DESCRIPTION
            _C_a_l_l_o_c() attempts  to  obtain  a  contiguous  block  of
            dynamic  memory  which  will  hold cnt objects, each of
            length size.  The  block  is  filled  with  zeroes.   A
            pointer  to  the  block is returned, or 0 if the memory
            could not be allocated.

       DESCRIPTION
            _C_p_u_t_s() will read one line of input  from  the  console
            into  the  buffer  passed as an argument. It does so by
            repeated calls to _g_e_t_c_h_e().  _C_p_u_t_s() writes  its  argu-
            ment string to the console, outputting carriage returns
            before each newline in the  string.  It  calls  _p_u_t_c_h()
            repeatedly.

   DESCRIPTION
        This function is availble only under MS-DOS. It changes
        the current working directory to the path name supplied
        as argument. This path  name  be  be  absolute,  as  in
        A:\FRED, or relative, as in ..\SOURCES.  A return value
        of -1 indicates that the requested change could not  be
        performed.

   SYNOPSIS

        #include  <stat.h>

        int chmod(char * name, int )
        char *    name;
        int mode;


   DESCRIPTION
        This function changes the file attributes (or modes) of
        the  named  file.   The  argument name may be any valid
        file name. The  mode  argument  may  include  all  bits
        defined  in _s_t_a_t._h except those relating to the type of
        the file, e.g. S_IFDIR. Note however that not all  bits
        may  be  changed under all operating systems, e.g. nei-
        ther DOS nor CP/M permit a file to be made  unreadable,
        thus  even  if  mode  does not include S_IREAD the file
        will still be readable (and _s_t_a_t()  will  still  return
        S_IREAD in flags).

       DESCRIPTION
            This routine closes the file associated with  the  file
            descriptor fd, which will have been previously obtained
            from a call to _o_p_e_n(). _C_l_o_s_e() returns 0 for a success-
            ful close, or -1 otherwise.

       DESCRIPTION
            These are macros, defined in stdio.h, which  reset  the
            error and end of file flags respectively for the speci-
            fied stream. They should be used with care;  the  major
            valid use is for clearing an EOF status on input from a
            terminal-like device, where it may be valid to continue
            to read after having seen an end-of-file indication.

       SYNOPSIS

            #include  <stat.h>

            int creat(char * name, int mode)


       DESCRIPTION
            This routine attempts to create the file named by name.
            If the file exists and is writeable, it will be removed
            and re-created. The return value is -1  if  the  create
            failed, or a small non-negative number if it succeeded.
            This number is a valuable token which must be  used  to
            write  to or close the file subsequently.  Mode is used
            to initialize the attributes of the created file.   The
            allowable  bits  are  the  same as for _c_h_m_o_d(), but for
            Unix compatibility it is recommended  that  a  mode  of
            0666  or 0600 be used. Under CP/M the mode is ignored -
            the only way to set  a  files  attributes  is  via  the
            _c_h_m_o_d() function.

                                  CTIME
       SYNOPSIS

            #include  <time.h>

            char *    ctime(time_t t)


       DESCRIPTION
            _C_t_i_m_e() converts the time in seconds pointed to by  its
            argument  to a string of the same form as described for
            asctime.  Thus the following program prints the current
            time and date:


                 #include  <time.h>

                 main()
                 {
                     time_t      t;

                     time(&t);
                     printf("%s", ctime(&t));

        div_t     div(int numer, int denom)
        ldiv_t    ldiv(long numer, long denom)


   DESCRIPTION
        The _d_i_v() function computes the quotient and  remainder
        of  the  divison of numer by denom.  The _d_i_v() function
        returns a structure of type div_t, containing both  the
        quotient  and  remainder.   _l_d_i_v()  is similar to _d_i_v()
        except it takes arguments of type long  and  returns  a
        structure  of  type ldiv_t.  The types div_t and ldiv_t
        are defined in <stdlib.h> as follows:

        typedef struct {
             intquot, rem;
        } div_t;

        typedef struct {
             longquot, rem;

            int dup(int fd)


       DESCRIPTION
            Given a file descriptor, such as  returned  by  _o_p_e_n(),
            this  routine will return another file descriptor which
            will refer to the same open file.  -1  is  returned  if
            the  fd  argument is a bad descriptor or does not refer
            to an open file.

   DESCRIPTION
        _E_x_e_c_l() and _e_x_e_c_v() load and execute the program speci-
        fied  by  the  string name. _E_x_e_c_l() takes the arguments
        for the program from the zero-terminated list of string
        arguments.  _E_x_e_c_v()  is passed a pointer to an array of
        strings.  The array must  be  zero-terminated.  If  the
        named  program  is found and can be read, the call does
        not return. Thus any return from these routines may  be
        treated as an error.

   DESCRIPTION
        This call will close all open files and exit  from  the
        program.  On  CP/M,  this  means a return to CCP level.
        Status will be stored in a known place for  examination
        by  other  programs. This is only useful if the program
        executing was actually invoked by another program which
        is trapping warm boots. The status value will be stored
        on CP/M at 80H.  This call will never return.

       DESCRIPTION
            _F_f_l_u_s_h() will output to the disk file or  other  device
            currently  open on the specified stream the contents of
            the associated  buffer.  This  is  typically  used  for
            flushing buffered standard output in interactive appli-
            cations.

   SYNOPSIS

        #include  <stdio.h>

        int fgetc(FILE * stream)


   DESCRIPTION
        _F_g_e_t_c() returns  the  next  character  from  the  input
        stream.   If  end-of-file  is  encountered  EOF will be
        returned instead. It is for this reason that the  func-
        tion is declared as int. The integer EOF is not a valid
        byte, thus end-of-file is distinguishable from  reading
        a  byte  of  all  1 bits from the file.  _F_g_e_t_c() is the
        non-macro version of _g_e_t_c().

   SYNOPSIS

        char * fgets(char * s, size_t n, char * stream)


   DESCRIPTION
        _F_g_e_t_s() places in the buffer s  up  to  n-1  characters
        from  the  input  stream.  If  a newline is seen in the
        input before the correct number of characters is  read,
        then  _f_g_e_t_s() will return immediately. The newline will
        be left in the buffer. The buffer  will  be  null  ter-
        minated  in any case.  A successful _f_g_e_t_s() will return
        its first argument; NULL is returned on end-of-file  or
        error.

       DESCRIPTION
            _F_i_l_e_n_o() is a macro from stdio.h which yields the  file
            descriptor  associated  with  stream. It is mainly used
            when it is desired to perform some low-level  operation
            on a file opened as a stdio stream.

       SYNOPSIS

            FILE * fopen(char * name, char * mode);


       DESCRIPTION


       DESCRIPTION
            _F_o_p_e_n() attempts to open file for  reading  or  writing
            (or  both)  according to the mode string supplied.  The
            mode string is interpreted as follows:

       r    The file is opend for reading if it exists. If the file
            does not exist the call fails.

       r+   If the file exists it is opened for reading  and  writ-
            ing. If the file does not already exist the call fails.

       w    The file is created if it does not exist, or  truncated
            if it does. It is then opened for writing.

       w+   The file is created if it does not  already  exist,  or
            truncated  if  it does.  The file is opened for reading
            and writing.

       a    The file is created if it does not already  exist,  and
            opened  for  writing.   All  writes will be dynamically
            forced to the end of file, thus this mode is  known  as
            _a_p_p_e_n_d mode.

       a+   The file is created if it does not already  exist,  and
            opened  for reading and writing. All writes to the file
            will be dynamically forced to the end of the file, i.e.
            while  any  portion of the file may be read, all writes

        will take place at the end of the  file  and  will  not
        overwrite  any  existing  data.   Calling _f_s_e_e_k() in an
        attempt to write at any other place in  the  file  will
        not be effective.

        The "b" modifier may be appended to any  of  the  above
   modes,  e.g.  "r+b"  or "rb+" are equivalent. Adding the "b"
   modifier will cause the file to be opened in  binary  rather
   than  ASCII  mode.  Opening  in ASCII mode ensures that text
   files are read in a manner compatible with the  Unix-derived
   conventions  for  C  programs,  i.e. that text files contain
   lines delimited by newline characters.  The  special  treat-
   ment of read or written characters varies with the operating
   system, but includes some or all of the following:

   NEWLINE (LINE FEED)
        Converted to carriage return, line feed on output.

   RETURN
        Ignored on input, inserted before NEWLINE on output.

   CTRL-Z
        Signals EOF on input, appended on fclose on  output  if
        necessary on CP/M.

        Opening a file in binary mode will allow each character
        to  be read just as written, but because the exact size
        of a file is not known to CP/M, the  file  may  contain
        more  bytes  than were written to it.  See _o_p_e_n() for a
        description of what constitutes a file name.

        When using one of the  read/write  modes  (with  a  '+'
   character  in the string), although they permits reading and
   writing on the same stream, it  is  not  possible  to  arbi-
   trarily  mix  input  and output calls to the same stream. At
   any given time a stream opened with a "+" mode  will  be  in
   either  an  input  or  output  state.  The state may only be
   changed when the associated buffer is empty, which  is  only
   guaranteed  immediately  after  a call to _f_f_l_u_s_h() or one of
   the file positioning  functions  _f_s_e_e_k()  or  _r_e_w_i_n_d().  The
   buffer will also be empty after encountering EOF while read-
   ing a binary stream, but it is recommended that an  explicit
   call  to  _f_f_l_u_s_h()  be  used  to ensure this situation. Thus
   after reading from a stream  you  should  call  _f_f_l_u_s_h()  or
   _f_s_e_e_k()  before attempting to write on that stream, and vice
   versa.

            _F_p_r_i_n_t_f() performs formatted printing on the  specified
            stream. Refer to _p_r_i_n_t_f() for the details of the avail-
            able formats.  _V_f_p_r_i_n_t_f() is similar to  _f_p_r_i_n_t_f()  but
            takes  a  variable  argument list pointer rather than a
            list of arguments. See the  description  of  _v_a__s_t_a_r_t()

            int fputc(int c, FILE * stream)


       DESCRIPTION
            The character c is written to the supplied stream. This
            is  the  non-macro  version of _p_u_t_c(). The character is
            returned  if  it  was  successfully  written,  EOF   is
            returned  otherwise.  Note that "written to the stream"
            may mean only placing the character in the buffer asso-
            ciated with the stream.

   DESCRIPTION
        The null-terminated string s is written to the  stream.
        No  newline is appended (cf. _p_u_t_s() ). The error return
        is EOF.

   DESCRIPTION
        Up to cnt objects, each of length size, are  read  into
        memory  at buf from the stream. The return value is the
        number of objects read. If none  is  read,  0  will  be
        returned.   Note that a return value less than cnt, but
        greater  than  0,  may  not  represent  an  error  (cf.
        _f_w_r_i_t_e() ).  No word alignment in the stream is assumed
        or necessary. The read is done via successive _g_e_t_c()'s.

            _F_r_e_o_p_e_n() closes the given stream (if  open)  then  re-
            opens  the  stream  attached  to  the file described by
            name. The mode of opening is given by mode.  It  either

        double    ldexp(double f, int i)


   DESCRIPTION
        _F_r_e_x_p() breaks a floating point number into  a  normal-
        ized  fraction  and an integral power of 2. The integer
        is stored into the int object pointed  to  by  p.   Its
        return  value  x is in the interval [0.5, 1.0) or zero,
        and f equals x times 2 raised to the  power  stored  in
        *p.   If  f is zero, both parts of the result are zero.
        _L_d_e_x_p() performs the reverse operation; the  integer  i
        is  added  to  the exponent of the floating point f and
        the resultant value returned.

   SYNOPSIS

   DESCRIPTION
        This routine performs formatted input from  the  speci-
        fied  stream. See _s_c_a_n_f() for a full description of the
        behaviour of the  routine.   _V_f_s_c_a_n_f()  is  similar  to
        _f_s_c_a_n_f()  but  takes  a  variable argument list pointer
        rather than a list of arguments. See the description of
        _v_a__s_t_a_r_t()  for  more  information on variable argument
        lists.

       SYNOPSIS

            #include  <stdio.h>

            int fseek(FILE * stream, long offs, int wh)


       DESCRIPTION
            _F_s_e_e_k() positions the "file pointer" (i.e. a pointer to
            the next character to be read or written) of the speci-
            fied stream as follows:

                         _____________________________
                        |_w_h__|____r_e_s_u_l_t_a_n_t__l_o_c_a_t_i_o_n____|
                        | 0 |  offs                  |
                        | 1 |  offs+previous location|
                        | 2 |  offs+length of file   |
                        |____|_________________________|


            It should be noted that offs is a  signed  value.  Thus
            the  3  allowed  modes  give postioning relative to the
            beginning of the file, the current file pointer and the
            end  of  the  file respectively. EOF is returned if the
            positioning request could not be satisfied.  Note  how-
            ever  that  positioning  beyond  the end of the file is
            legal, but will result  in  an  EOF  indication  if  an
            attempt  is  made  to  read  data there. It is quite in
            order to write data beyond the previous  end  of  file.
            _F_s_e_e_k() correctly accounts for any buffered data.

   DESCRIPTION
        Cnt objects of length size bytes will be  written  from
        memory  at  buf, to the specified stream. The number of
        whole objects written will be returned, or  0  if  none
        could  be  written.  Any  return value not equal to cnt
        should be treated as an error (cf. _f_r_e_a_d() ).

       DESCRIPTION
            This routine performs I/O redirection (CP/M  only)  and
            wild  card  expansion.  Under MS-DOS I/O redirection is
            performed by the operating system. It  is  called  from
            startup  code  to operate on the command line if the -R
            option is used to the C command, but may also be called
            by  user-written  code. If the buf argument is null, it
            will read lines of text from  standard  input.  If  the
            standard  input is a terminal (usually the console) the
            name argument will be written  to  the  standard  error
            stream as a prompt. If the buf argument is not null, it
            will be used as the source of the  string  to  be  pro-
            cessed.  The returned value is a pointer to an array of
            strings, exactly as would be pointed  to  by  the  argv
            argument  to the main() function. The number of strings
            in the array may be obtained from  the  global  _argc_.
            For example, a typical use of this function would be:

            #include  <sys.h>

            main(argc, argv)
            char ** argv;
            {
                extern char ** _getargs();
                extern int  _argc_;

                if(argc == 1) {/* no arguments */
                argv = _getargs(0, "myname");
                argc = _argc_;
                }
                .
                .
                .
            }

            There will be one string in the array for each word  in
            the  buffer  processed.   Quotes,  either single (') or
            double (") may  be  used  to  include  white  space  in
            "words". If any wild card characters (? or *) appear in
            a non-quoted word, it will be expanded into a string of
            words,  one  for each file matching the word. The usual
            CP/M conventions are followed for  this  expansion.  On
            CP/M  any occurence of the redirection characters > and
            < outside quotes  will  be  handled  in  the  following
            manner:

       > name
            will cause standard output to be redirected to the file
            name.

   < name
        will cause standard input to  be  redirected  from  the
        file name.

   >> name
        will cause standard output to append to file name.

        White space is optional between the >  or  <  character
        and  the  file  name,  however  it  is  an  error for a
        redirection character not to  be  followed  by  a  file
        name.   It  is also an error if a file cannot be opened
        for input or created for output.  An append redirection
        (>>) will create the file if it does not exist.  If the
        source of text  to  be  processed  is  standard  input,
        several  lines  may  be  supplied  by  ending each line
        (except the last) with a backslash (\).  This serves as
        a continuation character. Note that the newline follow-
        ing the backslash is ignored, and not treated as  white
        space.




                               GETC
   SYNOPSIS

        #include  <stdio.h>

        int getc(FILE * stream)
        FILE * stream;


   DESCRIPTION
        One character is read from  the  specified  stream  and
        returned. EOF will be returned on end-of-file or error.
        This is the macro version of _f_g_e_t_c(), and is defined in
        stdio.h.

            void      putch(int c)


       DESCRIPTION
            _G_e_t_c_h() reads a single character from the console  key-
            board  and  returns  it  without  echoing.  _G_e_t_c_h_e() is
            similar but does echo the character  typed.   _U_n_g_e_t_c_h()
            will push back one character such that the next call to
            _g_e_t_c_h()  or  _g_e_t_c_h_e()  will  return   that   character.
            _P_u_t_c_h()  outputs the character c to the console screen,
            prepending a carriage return if the character is a new-
            line.

       DESCRIPTION
            _G_e_t_c_h_a_r() is a _g_e_t_c(_s_t_d_i_n) operation.  It  is  a  macro
            defined   in  stdio.h.  Note  that  under  normal  cir-
            cumstances getchar() will NOT return unless a  carriage
            return  has  been typed on the console. To get a single
            character immediately from the console, use the routine
            _g_e_t_c_h().

   SYNOPSIS

   DESCRIPTION
        _G_e_t_c_w_d() returns the path name of the  current  working
        directory  on  the  specified  drive,  where drive == 0
        represents the current drive, drive == 1 represents A:,
        drive  ==  2  represents B: etc.  The return value is a
        pointer to a  static  area  of  memory  which  will  be
        overwritten on the next call to _g_e_t_c_w_d().

        #include  <stdlib.h>

        char *    getenv(char * s)
        extern char **  environ;


   DESCRIPTION
        _G_e_t_e_n_v() will search the vector of environment  strings
        for  one matching the argument supplied, and return the
        value part of that environment string. For example,  if
        the environment contains the string

             COMSPEC=A:\COMMAND.COM

        then _g_e_t_e_n_v("_C_O_M_S_P_E_C") will return A:\COMMAND.COM.  The
        global  variable  environ  is  a pointer to an array of
        pointers to environment strings, terminated by  a  null
        pointer.  This  array  is  initialized  at startup time
        under MS-DOS from the environment pointer supplied when
        the  program was executed.  Under CP/M no such environ-
        ment is supplied, so the first call  to  _g_e_t_e_n_v()  will
        attempt  to  open  a file in the current user number on
        the current drive called ENVIRON. This file should con-
        tain  definitions for any environment variables desired
        to be accessible to the program, e.g.

        HITECH=0:C:

        Each variable definition should be on a separate  line,
        consisting  of the variable name (conventionally all in
        upper case) followed without intervening white space by

       DESCRIPTION
            _G_e_t_s() reads a line from standard input into the buffer
            at  s,  deleting the newline (cf. _f_g_e_t_s() ). The buffer
            is null terminated. It returns its argument, or NULL on
            end-of-file.

       DESCRIPTION
            _G_e_t_u_i_d() returns the current user number.  On CP/M, the
            current  user number determines the user number associ-
            ated with an opened or created file, unless  overridden
            by an explicit user number prefix in the file name.

   SYNOPSIS

        int getw(FILE * stream)


   DESCRIPTION
        _G_e_t_w() returns one word (16 bits for the Z80 and  8086)
        from  the  nominated stream. EOF is returned on end-of-
        file, but since this is  a  perfectly  good  word,  the
        _f_e_o_f()  macro  should  be  used for testing for end-of-
        file.  When reading the word, no special  alignment  in
        the  file is necessary, as the read is done by two con-
        secutive _g_e_t_c()'s.  The byte ordering is however  unde-
        fined.  The word read should in general have been writ-
        ten by _p_u_t_w().

        struct tm *     gmtime(time_t * t)
        struct tm *     localtime(time_t * t)


   DESCRIPTION
        These functions convert the time pointed to by t  which
        is  in  seconds  since  00:00:00 on Jan 1, 1970, into a
        broken down time stored in a structure  as  defined  in
        _t_i_m_e._h.  _G_m_t_i_m_e() performs a straight conversion, while
        _l_o_c_a_l_t_i_m_e() takes into account the contents of the glo-
        bal  integer time_zone.  This should contain the number
        of minutes that the local  time  zone  is  WESTWARD  of
        Greenwich.  Since there is no way under MS-DOS of actu-
        ally pre-determining this value, by default _l_o_c_a_l_t_i_m_e()
        will return the same result as _g_m_t_i_m_e().

       DESCRIPTION
            These routines read and write bytes  to  and  from  I/O
            ports.   _I_n_p()  returns  the  data  byte  read from the
            specified port, and _o_u_t_p() outputs the data byte to the
            specified port.

            int int86(int intno, union REGS * inregs,

            int intdosx(union REGS * inregs, union REGS * outregs,
                struct SREGS * segregs)


       DESCRIPTION
            These functions allow calling  of  software  interrupts
            from  C  programs.   _I_n_t_8_6()  and  _i_n_t_8_6_x() execute the
            software interrupt specified by  _i_n_t_n_o  while  _i_n_t_d_o_s()
            and  _i_n_t_d_o_s_x()  execute interrupt 21(hex), which is the
            MS-DOS  system  call  interrupt.   The  inregs  pointer
            should  point  to a union containing values for each of
            the general purpose registers to be set when  executing
            the  interrupt,  and  the  values  of  the registers on
            return are copied into the union pointed to by outregs.
            The  _x  versions  of the calls also take a pointer to a
            union defining the segment register values to be set on
            execution  of  the interrupt, though only ES and DS are
            actually set from this structure.

            int isatty(int fd)


       DESCRIPTION
            This tests the type of the file associated with fd.  It
            returns true if the file is attached to a tty-like dev-
            ice. This would normally be used for testing  if  stan-
            dard  input  is  coming from a file or the console. For
            testing STDIO streams, use _i_s_a_t_t_y(_f_i_l_e_n_o(_s_t_r_e_a_m)).

   SYNOPSIS

        #include <setjmp.h>

        void      longjmp(jmp_buf buf, int val)


   DESCRIPTION
        _L_o_n_g_j_m_p(), in conjunction  with  _s_e_t_j_m_p(),  provides  a
        mechanism  for  non-local  gotos. To use this facility,
        _s_e_t_j_m_p() should be called with a  jmp_buf  argument  in
        some  outer level function. The call from _s_e_t_j_m_p() will
        return  0.  To  return  to  this  level  of  execution,
        _l_o_n_j_m_p()  may  be called with the same jmp_buf argument
        from an inner level of execution. Note however that the
        function  which  called  _s_e_t_j_m_p()  must still be active
        when _l_o_n_g_j_m_p() is called.  Breach  of  this  rule  will
        cause  disaster,  due  to the use of a stack containing
        invalid data. The val argument to _l_o_n_g_j_m_p() will be the
        value  apparently  returned  from  the  _s_e_t_j_m_p().  This
        should normally be non-zero, to distinguish it from the
        genuine _s_e_t_j_m_p() call. For example:

        #include <setjmp.h>

        static jmp_buf  jb_err;

        main()
        {
            if(setjmp(jb_err)) {
            printf("An error occured0);
            exit(1);
            }
            a_func();
        }

        a_func()
        {
            if(do_whatever() != 0)
            longjmp(jb_err, 1);
            if(do_something_else() != 0)
            longjmp(jb_err, 2);
        }


        The calls to _l_o_n_g_j_m_p() above will never return;  rather
        the  call to _s_e_t_j_m_p() will appear to return, but with a
        return  value  equal  to  the  argument   supplied   to
        _l_o_n_g_j_m_p().

            long lseek(int fd, long offs, int wh)


       DESCRIPTION
            This  function  operates  in  an  analogous  manner  to
            _f_s_e_e_k(), however it does so on unbuffered low-level i/o
            file descriptors, rather than on STDIO streams. It also
            returns  the resulting pointer location. Thus _l_s_e_e_k(_f_d,
            _0_L, _1) returns the  current  pointer  location  without
            moving it.  -1 is returned on error.

       SYNOPSIS

            #include  <stdlib.h>

            void * malloc(size_t cnt)


       DESCRIPTION
            _M_a_l_l_o_c() attempts to allocate cnt bytes of memory  from
            the "heap", the dynamic memory allocation area. If suc-
            cessful, it returns a pointer to the block, otherwise 0
            is  returned. The memory so allocated may be freed with
            _f_r_e_e(), or changed  in  size  via  _r_e_a_l_l_o_c().  _M_a_l_l_o_c()
            calls _s_b_r_k() to obtain memory, and is in turn called by
            _c_a_l_l_o_c().  _M_a_l_l_o_c()  does  not  clear  the  memory   it
            obtains.

   SYNOPSIS

        #include  <string.h>

        void      memset(void s, char c, size_t n)
        void *    memcpy(void * d, void * s, size_t n)
        int memcmp(void * s1, void * s2, size_t n)
        void *    memmove(void * s1, void * s2, size_t n)
        void *    memchr(void * s, int c, size_t n)


   DESCRIPTION
        _M_e_m_s_e_t() initializes n bytes of memory starting at  the
        location pointed to by s with the character c. _M_e_m_c_p_y()
        copies n bytes of memory  starting  from  the  location
        pointed to by s to the block of memory pointed to by d.
        The result of copying overlapping blocks is  undefined.
        _M_e_m_c_m_p()  compares  two  blocks of memory, of length n,
        and returns a signed value similar to _s_t_r_n_c_m_p(). Unlike
        _s_t_r_n_c_m_p() the comparision does not stop on a null char-
        acter. The ascii collating sequence  is  used  for  the
        comparision,  but  the  effect  of  including non-ascii
        characters in the memory blocks on  the  sense  of  the
        return  value is indeterminate. _M_e_m_m_o_v_e() is similar to
        _m_e_m_c_p_y() except copying of overlapping blocks  is  han-
        dled correctly. The _m_e_m_c_h_r() function locates the first
        occurence of c (converted to unsigned char) in the ini-
        tial n characters of the object pointed to by s.

            tion  (_r_m_d_i_r())  of  sub-directories  under  the MS-DOS
            operating system. The argument s may  be  an  arbitrary

                int bx, int si, int di)


       DESCRIPTION
            These functions allow direct access  to  MS-DOS  system
            calls.  The  arguments  will be placed in the registers
            implied by their names, while the return value will  be
            the contents of AX and DX (for _m_s_d_o_s()) or the contents
            of DX and CX (for _m_s_d_o_s_c_x()).  Only as  many  arguments
            as  necessary  need be supplied, e.g. if only AH and DX
            need have specified valued, then only 2 argument  would
            be  required.  The  following  piece  of code outputs a
            form-feed to the printer.

                 msdos(0x500, '\f');

            Note that the system call number (in this case 5)  must
            be  multiplied  by  0x100 since MS-DOS expects the call
            number in AH, the high byte of AX.

   SYNOPSIS

        #include  <unixio.h>

        int open(char * name, int mode)


   DESCRIPTION
        _O_p_e_n() is the fundamental means of  opening  files  for
        reading  and  writing.   The  file specified by name is
        sought, and if found is opened for reading, writing  or
        both. Mode is encoded as follows:

             Mode      Meaning
             0   Open for reading only
             1   Open for writing only
             2   Open for both reading and writing


        The file must already exist - if it does  not,  _c_r_e_a_t()
        should  be  used to create it.  On a successful open, a
        file descriptor is returned.  This  is  a  non-negative
        integer  which  may  be  used to refer to the open file
        subsequently.  If the open fails, -1 is returned.   The
        syntax of a CP/M filename is:

             [uid:][drive:]name.type


        where uid is a decimal number  0  to  15,  drive  is  a
        letter  A to P or a to p, name is 1 to 8 characters and
        type is  0  to  3  characters.  Though  there  are  few
        inherent restrictions on the characters in the name and
        type, it is recommended that they be restricted to  the
        alphanumerics and standard printing characters.  Use of
        strange characters  may  cause  problems  in  accessing
        and/or deleting the file.

        One or both of uid: and drive: may be omitted; if  both
        are supplied, the uid: must come first. Note that the [
        and ] are meta-symbols only. Some examples are:

             fred.dat
             file.c
             0:xyz.com
             0:a:file1.p
             a:file2.


        If the uid: is omitted, the file will  be  sought  with
        uid  equal  to  the current user number, as returned by
        getuid(). If drive: is omitted, the file will be sought
        on  the currently selected drive. The following special
        file names are recognized:

                 lst:      Accesses the list device - write only
                 pun:      Accesses the punch device - write only
                 rdr:      Accesses the reader device - read only
                 con:      Accesses the system console - read/write


            File names may be in any case - they are  converted  to
            upper case during processing of the name.

            MS-DOS filenames may be any valid MS-DOS 2.xx filename,
            e.g.

                 fred.nrk
                 A:\HITECH\STDIO.H


            The special device  names  (e.g.  CON,  LST)  are  also
            recognized.  These do not require (and should not have)
            a trailing colon.

            #include  <stdio.h>

            void      perror(char * s)


       DESCRIPTION
            This routine will print on the stderr stream the  argu-
            ment s, followed by a descriptive message detailing the
            last error returned from an open, close read  or  write
            call.  Unfortunately  CP/M  does not provide definitive
            information relating to the error, except in  the  case
            of a random read or write. Thus this routine is of lim-
            ited usefulness under CP/M. MS-DOS provides  much  more
            information  however,  and use of _p_e_r_r_o_r() after MS-DOS
            file handling calls will certainly give useful diagnos-
            tics.

        int vprintf(char * fmt, va_list va_arg)


   DESCRIPTION
        _P_r_i_n_t_f() is a formatted output  routine,  operating  on
        stdout. There are corresponding routines operating on a
        given  stream  (_f_p_r_i_n_t_f())  or  into  a  string  buffer
        (_s_p_r_i_n_t_f()).  _P_r_i_n_t_f()  is passed a format string, fol-
        lowed by a list of zero or more arguments. In the  for-
        mat string are conversion specifications, each of which
        is used to print out one of the argument  list  values.
        Each  conversion  specification  is  of  the form %m.nc
        where the percent symbol  %  introduces  a  conversion,
        followed by an optional width specification m.  n is an
        optional precision  specification  (introduced  by  the
        dot)  and  c  is  a  letter  specifying the type of the
        conversion.  A minus sign ('-') preceding  m  indicates
        left  rather  than  right  adjustment  of the converted
        value in the field. Where the  field  width  is  larger
        than required for the conversion, blank padding is per-
        formed at the left or right as specified.  Where  right
        adjustment  of  a  numeric conversion is specified, and
        the first digit of m is 0, then padding  will  be  per-
        formed with zeroes rather than blanks.

        If the character * is used in place of a  decimal  con-
        stant,  e.g.  in the format %*d, then one integer argu-
        ment will be taken from the list to provide that value.
        The types of conversion are:

   f    Floating point - m is the total  width  and  n  is  the
        number  of  digits  after  the  decimal point.  If n is
        omitted it defaults to 6.

   e    Print the corresponding argument  in  scientific  nota-
        tion. Otherwise similar to f.

   g    Use e or f format, whichever gives maximum precision in
        minimum width.

   o x X u d
        Integer conversion -  in  radices  8,  16,  10  and  10
        respectively.  The  conversion is signed in the case of
        d, unsigned otherwise. The precision value is the total
        number  of  digits  to  print, and may be used to force
        leading zeroes. E.g. %8.4x will print at  least  4  hex
        digits  in  an  8 wide field.  Preceding the key letter
        with an l indicates that the value argument is  a  long
        integer  or  unsigned  value.   The letter X prints out
        hexadecimal numbers using the upper  case  letters  _A-_F
        rather than _a-_f as would be printed when using x.

       s    Print a string - the value argument is assumed to be  a
            character pointer. At most n characters from the string
            will be printed, in a field m characters wide.

       c    The argument is assumed to be a single character and is
            printed literally.

            Any other characters used as conversion  specifications
            will  be printed. Thus %% will produce a single percent
            sign.  Some examples:

            printf("Total = %4d%%", 23)
                yields 'Total =23%'
            printf("Size is %lx" , size)
                where size is a long, prints size
                as hexadecimal.
            printf("Name = %.8s", "a1234567890")
                yields 'Name = a1234567'
            printf("xx%*d", 3, 4)
                yields 'xx  4'


            Printf returns EOF on error, 0 otherwise.  _V_p_r_i_n_t_f() is
            similar  to _p_r_i_n_t_f() but takes a variable argument list
            pointer rather  than  a  list  of  arguments.  See  the
            description of _v_a__s_t_a_r_t() for more information on vari-
            able argument lists.

            int putw(int w, FILE * stream)


       DESCRIPTION
            _P_u_t_w() copies the  word  w  to  the  given  stream.  It
            returns  w,  except  on  error,  in  which  case EOF is
            returned. Since this is a good integer, _f_e_r_r_o_r() should
            be used to check for errors.

   SYNOPSIS

        #include  <stdlib.h>

        void      qsort(void * base, size_t nel,
            size_t width, int (*func)())


   DESCRIPTION
        _Q_s_o_r_t() is an implementation  of  the  quicksort  algo-
        rithm.  It  sorts an array of nel items, each of length
        width bytes, located contiguously in  memory  at  base.
        Func is a pointer to a function used by _q_s_o_r_t() to com-
        pare items. It calls func with pointers to two items to
        be  compared.   If  the  first item is considered to be
        greater than, equal to or less  than  the  second  then
        _f_u_n_c()  should  return a value greater than zero, equal
        to zero or less than zero respectively.

        static short    array[100];

        #define SIZE  sizeof array/sizeof array[0]
        a_func(p1, p2)
        short * p1, * p2;
        {
            return *p1 - *p2;
        }

        {
            qsort(array, SIZE,
                  sizeof array[0], a_func);
        }


        This will sort the array into  ascending  values.  Note
        the  use  of sizeof to make the code independent of the
        size of a short, or  the  number  of  elements  in  the
        array.

            int rand(void)


       DESCRIPTION
            _R_a_n_d() is a pseudo-random number generator. It  returns
            an  integer in the range 0 to 32767, which changes in a
            pseudo-random fashion on each call.

            int read(int fd, void * buf, size_t cnt)


       DESCRIPTION
            _R_e_a_d() will read from the file associated with fd up to
            cnt  bytes into a buffer located at buf. It returns the
            number of bytes actually read. A zero return  indicates
            end-of-file.  A  negative  return  indicates  error. Fd
            should have been  obtained  from  a  previous  call  to
            _o_p_e_n().  It is possible for _r_e_a_d() to return less bytes
            than requested, e.g. when reading from the console,  in
            which case _r_e_a_d() will read one line of input.

   SYNOPSIS

        void * realloc(void * ptr, size_t cnt)


   DESCRIPTION
        _R_e_a_l_l_o_c() frees the  block  of  memory  at  ptr,  which
        should  have  been  obtained by a previous call to _m_a_l_-
        _l_o_c(), _c_a_l_l_o_c() or _r_e_a_l_l_o_c(), then attempts to allocate
        cnt  bytes  of dynamic memory, and if successful copies
        the contents of the block of memory located at ptr into
        the new block.  At most, _r_e_a_l_l_o_c() will copy the number
        of bytes which were in the old block, but  if  the  new
        block  is  smaller,  will  only copy cnt bytes.  If the
        block could not be allocated, 0 is returned.

            read/write  pointer  of  the  nominated  stream  to the
            beginning of the file. A return value of  -1  indicates
            that  the  attempt  was not successful, perhaps because
            the stream is associated with a non-random access  file
            such as a character device.

   DESCRIPTION
        _S_b_r_k() increments the current highest  memory  location
        allocated  to  the program by incr bytes.  It returns a
        pointer to the previous highest location. Thus  _s_b_r_k(_0)
        returns  a  pointer  to  the  current highest location,
        without altering its value.  If there  is  insufficient
        memory to satisfy the request, -1 is returned.

        int scanf(char * fmt, ...)
        int vscanf(char *, va_list ap);


   DESCRIPTION
        _S_c_a_n_f() performs formatted  input  ("de-editing")  from
        the  stdin  stream. Similar functions are available for
        streams in general,  and  for  strings.   The  function
        _v_s_c_a_n_f() is similar, but takes a pointer to an argument
        list rather than a series of additional arguments. This
        pointer  should  have been initialized with _v_a__s_t_a_r_t().
        The input conversions are performed  according  to  the
        fmt string; in general a character in the format string
        must match a character in the input;  however  a  space
        character  in the format string will match zero or more
        "white space" characters in  the  input,  i.e.  spaces,
        tabs or newlines.  A conversion specification takes the
        form of the character  %,  optionally  followed  by  an
        assignment suppression character ('*'), optionally fol-
        lowed by a numerical maximum field width, followed by a
        conversion  specification  character.  Each  conversion
        specification, unless it  incorporates  the  assignment
        suppression character, will assign a value to the vari-
        able pointed at by the next argument. Thus if there are
        two  conversion specifications in the fmt string, there
        should  be  two  additional  pointer  arguments.    The
        conversion characters are as follows:

   o x d
        Skip white space, then convert a number in base  8,  16
        or   10  radix  respectively.  If  a  field  width  was






       HI-TECH C USER'S MANUAL                             Page 151

            supplied, take at most that many  characters  from  the
            input. A leading minus sign will be recognized.

       f    Skip white space, then convert  a  floating  number  in
            either  conventional or scientific notation.  The field
            width applies as above.

       s    Skip white space, then copy a maximal  length  sequence
            of  non-white-space  characters.  The  pointer argument
            must be a pointer to char.  The field width will  limit
            the  number  of characters copied. The resultant string
            will be null-terminated.

       c    Copy the next character from  the  input.  The  pointer
            argument is assumed to be a pointer to char. If a field
            width is specified, then  copy  that  many  characters.
            This differs from the s format in that white space does
            not terminate the character sequence.

            The conversion characters o, x, u, d and f may be  pre-
            ceded  by  an  l  to  indicate  that  the corresponding
            pointer argument is a pointer  to  long  or  double  as
            appropriate.  A  preceding  h  will  indicate  that the
            pointer argument is a pointer to short rather than int.

            _S_c_a_n_f() returns the number of  successful  conversions;
            EOF  is  returned  if  end-of-file  was seen before any
            conversions were performed. Some examples are:

                 scanf("%d %s", &a, &s)
                     with input "12s"
                 will assign 12 to a, and "s" to s.

                 scanf("%4cd %lf", &c, &f)
                     with input " abcd -3.5"
                 will assign " abc" to c, and -3.5 to f.

            void      setbuf(FILE * stream, char * buf)


       DESCRIPTION
            The _s_e_t_v_b_u_f() function allows the  buffering  behaviour
            of  a  STDIO  stream  to  be altered. It supersedes the
            function _s_e_t_b_u_f() which is retained for backwards  com-
            patibility.  The arguments to _s_e_t_v_b_u_f() are as follows:
            stream designates the STDIO stream to be affected;  buf
            is  a  pointer  to  a buffer which will be used for all
            subsequent I/O operations on this  stream.  If  buf  is
            null,  then the routine will allocate a buffer from the
            heap  if  necessary,  of  size  BUFSIZ  as  defined  in
            <stdio.h>.   mode  may  take the values _IONBF, to turn
            buffering off completely, _IOFBF, for  full  buffering,
            or _IOLBF for line buffering. Full buffering means that
            the associated buffer will only be flushed  when  full,
            while  line  buffering  means  that  the buffer will be
            flushed at the end  of  each  line  or  when  input  is
            requested  from  another STDIO stream. size is the size
            of the buffer supplied. For example:

              setvbuf(stdout, my_buf, _IOLBF, sizeof my_buf);

            If a buffer is supplied by the caller, that buffer will
            remain  associated  with that stream even over_f_c_l_o_s_e(),
            _f_o_p_e_n() calls until another _s_e_t_v_b_u_f() changes it.

        typedef interrupt void (*isr)();
        isr set_vector(isr * vector, isr func);


   DESCRIPTION
        This routine allows an interrupt vector to be  initial-
        ized.  The  first argument should be the address of the
        interrupt vector (not the vector number but the  actual
        address) cast to a pointer to _i_s_r, which is a typedef'd
        pointer to an interrupt function. The  second  argument
        should  be  the  function  which you want the interrupt
        vector to point to. This must  be  declared  using  the
        _i_n_t_e_r_r_u_p_t   type   qualifier.   The   return  value  of
        _s_e_t__v_e_c_t_o_r() is the previous contents of the vector.

            void (* signal)(int sig, void (*func)());


       DESCRIPTION
            _S_i_g_n_a_l() provides a mechanism for catching  control-C's
            (ctrl-BREAK  for  MS-DOS)  typed  on the console during
            I/O. Under CP/M the console is polled whenever  an  I/O
            call is performed, while for MS-DOS the polling depends
            on the setting of the BREAK command.  If a control-C is
            detected  certain action will be performed. The default
            action is to exit summarily; this may be modified  with
            _s_i_g_n_a_l(). The sig argument to signal may at the present
            time be only SIGINT, signifying an interrupt condition.
            The  func  argument may be one of SIG_DFL, representing
            the default action, SIG_IGN, to ignore control-C's com-
            pletely,  or  the  address  of a function which will be
            called with one argument,  the  number  of  the  signal
            caught,  when  a  control-C is seen. As the only signal
            supported is SIGINT, this will always be the  value  of
            the argument to the called function.

            double    sin(double f);

   SYNOPSIS

        int spawnl(char * n, char * argv0, ...);
        int spawnv(cahr * n, char ** v)
        int spawnve(char * n, char ** v, char ** e)


   DESCRIPTION
        These functions will load and  execute  a  sub-program,
        named  by  the  argument n. The calling conventions are
        similar to  the  functions  _e_x_e_c_l()  and  _e_x_e_c_v(),  the
        difference being that the spawn functions return to the
        calling program after termination of  the  sub-program,
        while  the  exec  functions  return only if the program
        could not be executed.  _S_p_a_w_n_v_e() takes an  environment
        list in the same format as the argument list which will
        be supplied to the executed program as its environment.

        int sprintf(char * buf, char * fmt, ...);
        int vsprintf(char * buf, char * fmt, va_list ap);


   DESCRIPTION
        _S_p_r_i_n_t_f() operates in a similar  fashion  to  _p_r_i_n_t_f(),
        except  that instead of placing the converted output on
        the stdout stream, the characters  are  placed  in  the
        buffer  at  buf.  The  resultant  string  will be null-
        terminated, and the number of characters in the  buffer
        will  be  returned.  _V_s_p_r_i_n_t_f takes an argument pointer
        rather than a list of arguments.

            _S_s_c_a_n_f() operates  in  a  similar  manner  to  _s_c_a_n_f(),
            except that instead of the conversions being taken from
            stdin, they are taken from the string at buf.

   DESCRIPTION

        accessed by _r_a_n_d() with the given seed. This provides a
        mechanism  for  varying  the  starting  point  of   the
        pseudo-random sequence yielded by _r_a_n_d(). On the z80, a
        good place to get a  truly  random  seed  is  from  the
        refresh  register. Otherwise timing a response from the
        console will do.

   SYNOPSIS

        #include  <stat.h>

        int stat(char * name, struct stat * statbuf)


   DESCRIPTION
        This routine returns  information  about  the  file  by
        name.  The  information  returned  is  operating system
        dependent, but may include file attributes (e.g.   read
        only), file size in bytes, and file modification and/or
        access times.  The argument name should be the name  of
        the  file,  and  may include path names under DOS, user
        numbers under CP/M, etc.  The argument  statbuf  should
        be  the  address  of  a  structure as defined in _s_t_a_t._h
        which will be filled in with the information about  the
        file. The structure of _s_t_r_u_c_t _s_t_a_t is as follows:

        struct stat
        {
         short    st_mode;  /* flags */
         long     st_atime; /* access time */
         long     st_mtime; /* modification time */
         long     st_size;  /* file size */
        };


        The access and modification times (under DOS these
        are  both  set  to  the  modification time) are in
        seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1  1970.  The  function
        _c_t_i_m_e()  may be used to convert this to a readable

            char *    strncpy(char * s1, char * s2, size_t n);


       DESCRIPTION
            These functions provide operations  on  null-terminated
            strings.  _S_t_r_c_a_t()  appends the string s2 to the end of
            the string s1.  The string at  s1  will  be  null  ter-
            minated.  Needless  to say the buffer at s1 must be big
            enough. _S_t_r_c_m_p() compares the two strings and returns a
            number  greater  than  0,  0  or  a  number less than 0
            according to whether s1 is greater than,  equal  to  or
            less  than s2. The comparision is via the ascii collat-
            ing order, with the first character the  most  signifi-
            cant.   _S_t_r_c_p_y()  copies s2 into the buffer at s1, null
            terminating it.  _S_t_r_l_e_n() returns the length of s1, not
            including  the  terminating null.  _S_t_r_n_c_a_t(), _s_t_r_n_c_m_p()
            and _s_t_r_n_c_p_y() will catenate, compare and copy s2 and s1
            in  the  same  manner as their similarly named counter-
            parts above, but involving at most  n  characters.  For
            _s_t_r_n_c_p_y(),  the  resulting  string may not be null ter-
            minated.

   DESCRIPTION
        These functions locate an instance of the  character  c
        in the string s. In the case of _s_t_r_c_h_r() a pointer will
        be returned to the  first  instance  of  the  character
        found  be  searching  from the beginning of the string,
        while _s_t_r_r_c_h_r() searches backwards from the end of  the
        string.  A  null  pointer  is returned if the character
        does not exist in the string.

        int system(char * s)


   DESCRIPTION
        When executed under MS-DOS _s_y_s_t_e_m() will pass the argu-
        ment  string  to the command processor, located via the
        environment string COMSPEC,  for  execution.  The  exit
        status  of  the command processor will be returned from
        the call to system().  For example,  to  set  the  baud
        rate on the serial port on an MS-DOS machine:

             system("MODE COM1:96,N,8,1,P");

        This function will not work on CP/M-86  since  it  does
        not  have  an invokable command interpreter. Under Con-
        current CP/M the CLI system call is used.

            time_t    time(time_t * t)


       DESCRIPTION
            This function returns the current time in seconds since
            00:00:00  on  Jan  1,  1970.  If the argument t is non-
            null, the same value is stored into the object  pointed
            to  by  t.   The accuracy of this function is naturally
            dependent on the operating system  having  the  correct
            time. This function does not work under CP/M-86 or CP/M
            2.2 but does work under Concurrent-CP/M and CP/M+.

        tion will return the character. At most  one  level  of
        pushback will be allowed, and if the stream is not buf-
        fered, even this may not be possible. EOF  is  returned

            void      va_end(va_list ap);


       DESCRIPTION
            These macros are provided to give access in a  portable
            way to parameters to a function represented in a proto-
            type by the  ellipsis  symbol  (...),  where  type  and
            number  of  arguments  supplied to the function are not
            known at compile time. The rightmost parameter  to  the
            function  (shown  as  _p_a_r_m_N) plays an important role in
            these macros, as it is the starting point for access to
            further  parameters.  In  a  function  taking  variable
            numbers of arguments, a variable of type va_list should
            be  declared, then the macro va_start invoked with that
            variable and the name of _p_a_r_m_N.  This  will  initialize
            the  variable  to  allow  subsequent calls of the macro
            va_arg to access successive parameters.  Each  call  to
            va_arg  requires two arguments; the variable previously
            defined and a type name which is the type that the next
            parameter  is  expected  to be. Note that any arguments
            thus accessed will have been  widened  by  the  default
            conventions  to _i_n_t, _u_n_s_i_g_n_e_d _i_n_t or _d_o_u_b_l_e.  For exam-
            ple if a character argument has been passed, it  should
            be accessed by va_arg(ap, int) since the char will have
            been widened to _i_n_t.  An example is given  below  of  a
            function  taking  one  integer parameter, followed by a
            number of other parameters. In this example  the  func-
            tion  expects  the subsequent parameters to be pointers
            to char, but note that the compiler  is  not  aware  of
            this,  and  it  is  the  programmers  responsibility to

        on error.  In any case, any return value not  equal  to
        cnt should be treated as an error (cf. _r_e_a_d() ).

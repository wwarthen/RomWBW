Mtools is a collection of utilities to access MS-DOS disks from GNU and 
Unix without mounting them. It supports Win'95 style long file names, 
OS/2 Xdf disks and 2m disks (store up to 1992k on a high density 3 1/2 
disk). In addition to file access, it supports many FAT-specific 
features: volume labels, FAT-specific file attributes (hidden, system, 
...), "bad block" map maintenance, access to remote floppy drives, 
Iomega ZIP disk protection, "secure" erase, display of file's on-disk 
layout, etc.

This directory contains the mtools.exe executable from the Mtools
collection.  This executable was extracted from the Windows build
of Mtools which is found at https://github.com/YawHuei/mtools_win32.

The Mtools project website is found at https://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/
which hosts the source code.

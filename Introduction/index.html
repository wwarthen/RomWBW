<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>RomWBW software provides a complete, commercial quality implementation
of CP/M (and workalike) operating systems and applications for modern
Z80/180/280 retro-computing hardware systems.</p>
<p>A wide variety of platforms are supported including those produced by
these developer communities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org">RetroBrew Computers</a>

<li><a href="https://smallcomputercentral.com/">Small Computer Central</a>
  (<a href="https://smallcomputercentral.com/">https://smallcomputercentral.com/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A complete list of the currently supported platforms is found in <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20Hardware.pdf">RomWBW
Hardware</a>
.</p>
<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<h2 id="primary-features">Primary Features</h2>
<p>By design, RomWBW isolates all of the hardware specific functions in the
ROM chip itself. The ROM provides a hardware abstraction layer such that
all of the operating systems and applications on a disk will run on any
RomWBW-based system. To put it simply, you can take a disk (or CF/SD/USB
Card) and move it between systems transparently.</p>
<p>Supported hardware features of RomWBW include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Z80 Family CPUs including Z80, Z180, and Z280</li>
<li>Banked memory services for several banking designs</li>
<li>Disk drivers for RAM, ROM, Floppy, IDE ATA/ATAPI, CF, SD, USB, Zip,
  Iomega</li>
<li>Serial drivers including UART (16550-like), ASCI, ACIA, SIO</li>
<li>Video drivers including TMS9918, SY6545, MOS8563, HD6445</li>
<li>Keyboard (PS/2) drivers via VT8242 or PPI interfaces</li>
<li>Real time clock drivers including DS1302, BQ4845</li>
<li>Support for CP/NET networking using Wiznet, MT011 or Serial</li>
<li>Built-in VT-100 terminal emulation support</li>
</ul>
<p>A dynamic disk drive letter assignment mechanism allows mapping
operating system drive letters to any available disk media.
Additionally, mass storage devices (IDE Disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.)
support the use of multiple slices (up to 256 per device). Each slice
contains a complete CP/M filesystem and can be mapped independently to
any drive letter. This overcomes the inherent size limitations in legacy
OSes and allows up to 2GB of addressable storage on a single device,
with up to 128MB accessible at any one time.</p>
<h2 id="included-software">Included Software</h2>
<p>Multiple disk images are provided in the distribution. Most disk images
contain a complete, bootable, ready-to-run implementation of a specific
operating system. A “combo” disk image contains multiple slices, each
with a full operating system implementation. If you use this disk image,
you can easily pick whichever operating system you want to boot without
changing media.</p>
<p>Some of the included software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operating Systems (CP/M 2.2, ZSDOS, NZ-COM, CP/M 3, ZPM3, Z3PLUS, QPM
  )</li>
<li>Support for other operating systems, p-System, FreeRTOS, and FUZIX.</li>
<li>Programming Tools (Z80ASM, Turbo Pascal, Forth, Cowgol)</li>
<li>C Compiler’s including Aztec-C, and HI-TECH C</li>
<li>Microsoft Basic Compiler, and Microsoft Fortran</li>
<li>Some games such as Colossal Cave, Zork, etc</li>
<li>Wordstar Word processing software</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the provided software can be launched directly from the ROM
firmware itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Monitor</li>
<li>Operating Systems (CP/M 2.2, ZSDOS)</li>
<li>ROM BASIC (Nascom BASIC and Tasty BASIC)</li>
<li>ROM Forth</li>
</ul>
<p>A tool is provided that allows you to access a FAT-12/16/32 filesystem.
The FAT filesystem may be coresident on the same disk media as RomWBW
slices or on stand-alone media. This makes exchanging files with modern
OSes such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux very easy.</p>
<h2 id="rom-distribution">ROM Distribution</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW">RomWBW Repository</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW">https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW</a>) on GitHub is the official
distribution location for all project source and documentation.</p>
<p>RomWBW is distributed as both source code and pre-built ROM and disk
images.</p>
<p>The pre-built ROM images distributed with RomWBW are based on the
default system configurations as determined by the hardware
provider/designer. The pre-built ROM firmware images are generally
suitable for most users.</p>
<p>The fully-built distribution releases are available on the <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases">RomWBW
Releases Page</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases">https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases</a>) of the repository.</p>
<p>On this page, you will normally see a Development Snapshot as well as
recent stable releases. Unless you have a specific reason, I suggest you
stick to the most recent stable release.</p>
<p>The asset named RomWBW-vX.X.X-Package.zip includes all pre-built ROM and
Disk images as well as full source code. The other assets contain only
source code and do not have the pre-built ROM or disk images.</p>
<h4 id="distribution-directory-layout">Distribution Directory Layout</h4>
<p>The RomWBW distribution is a compressed zip archive file organized in a
set of directories. Each of these directories has its own ReadMe.txt
file describing the contents in detail. In summary, these directories
are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Directory</strong></th>
<th><strong>Description</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Binary</strong></td>
<td>The final output files of the build process are placed here. Most importantly, the ROM images with the file names ending in “.rom” and disk images ending in .img.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Doc</strong></td>
<td>Contains various detailed documentation, both RomWBW specifically as well as the operating systems and applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Source</strong></td>
<td>Contains the source code files used to build the software and ROM images.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tools</strong></td>
<td>Contains the programs that are used by the build process or that may be useful in setting up your system.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="building-from-source">Building from Source</h4>
<p>It is also very easy to modify and build custom ROM images that fully
tailor the firmware to your specific preferences. All tools required to
build custom ROM firmware under Windows are included – no need to
install assemblers, etc. The firmware can also be built using Linux or
MacOS after confirming a few standard tools have been installed.</p>
<h2 id="installation-operation">Installation &amp; Operation</h2>
<p>In general, installation of RomWBW on your platform is very simple. You
just need to program your ROM with the correct ROM image from the RomWBW
distribution. Subsequently, you can write disk images on your disk
drives (IDE disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.) which then provides even more
functionality.</p>
<p>Complete instructions for installation and operation of RomWBW are found
in the <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20User%20Guide.pdf">RomWBW User
Guide</a>.
It is also a good idea to review the <a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md">Release
Notes</a>
for helpful release-specific information.</p>

<p>There are several documents that form the core of the RomWBW
documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20User%20Guide.pdf">RomWBW User
  Guide</a>
  is the main user guide for RomWBW, it covers the major topics of how
  to install, manage and use RomWBW, and includes additional guidance to
  the use of some of the operating systems supported by RomWBW</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20Hardware.pdf">RomWBW
  Hardware</a>
  contains a description of all the hardware platforms, and devices
  supported by RomWBW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20Applications.pdf">RomWBW
  Applications</a>
  is a reference for the ROM-hosted and OS-hosted applications created
  or customized to enhance the operation of RomWBW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20Disk%20Catalog.pdf">RomWBW Disk
  Catalog</a>
  is a reference for the contents of the disk images provided with
  RomWBW, with a description of many of the files on each image</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/raw/master/Doc/RomWBW%20System%20Guide.pdf">RomWBW System
  Guide</a>
  discusses much of the internal design and construction of RomWBW. It
  includes a reference for the RomWBW HBIOS API functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the operating systems and ROM applications included with RomWBW
are sophisticated tools in their own right. It is not reasonable to
fully document their usage. However, you will find complete manuals in
PDF format in the Doc directory of the distribution. The intention of
this documentation is to describe the operation of RomWBW and the ways
in which it enhances the operation of the included applications and
operating systems.</p>
<p>Since RomWBW is purely a software product for many different platforms,
the documentation does <strong>not</strong> cover hardware construction,
configuration, or troubleshooting – please see your hardware provider
for this information.</p>

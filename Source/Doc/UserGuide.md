#### Preface

This document is a general usage guide for the RomWBW software and is
generally the best place to start with RomWBW.  There are several
companion documents you should refer to as appropriate:

* $doc_sys$ discusses much of the internal design and construction
  of RomWBW.  It includes a reference for the RomWBW HBIOS API
  functions.

* $doc_apps$ is a reference for the OS-hosted proprietary command
  line applications that were created to enhance RomWBW.

* $doc_romapps$ is a reference for the ROM-hosted applications provided
  with RomWBW including the monitor, programming languages, etc.

* $doc_catalog$ is a reference for the contents of the disk images
  provided with RomWBW.  It is somewhat out of date at this time.

* $doc_errata$ is updated as needed to document issues or anomalies
  discovered in the current software distribution.

Since RomWBW is purely a software product for many different platforms,
the documentation does **not** cover hardware construction,
configuration, or troubleshooting -- please see your hardware provider
for this information.

Each of the operating systems and ROM applications included with RomWBW
are sophisticated tools in their own right. It is not reasonable to
fully document their usage here. However, you will find complete manuals
in PDF format in the Doc directory of the distribution.  The intention
of this document is to describe the operation of RomWBW and the ways in
which it enhances the operation of the included applications and
operating systems.

On a personal note, I found this document very difficult to write.
Members of the retro-computing community have dramatically different
experiences, skill levels, and desires.  I realize some readers will
find this document far too basic.  Others will find it lacking in many
areas.  I am doing my best and encourage you to provide constructive
feedback.

# Overview

RomWBW software provides a complete, commercial quality 
implementation of CP/M (and workalike) operating systems and 
applications for modern Z80/180/280 retro-computing hardware systems.
A wide variety of platforms are supported including those
produced by these developer communities:

* [RetroBrew Computers](https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org)
* [RC2014](https://rc2014.co.uk), [RC2014-Z80](https://groups.google.com/g/rc2014-z80)
* [retro-comp](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/retro-comp)
* [Small Computer Central](https://smallcomputercentral.com/)

General features include:

* Banked memory services for several banking designs
* Disk drivers for RAM, ROM, Floppy, IDE, CF, and SD
* Serial drivers including UART (16550-like), ASCI, ACIA, SIO
* Video drivers including TMS9918, SY6545, MOS8563, HD6445
* Keyboard (PS/2) drivers via VT8242 or PPI interfaces
* Real time clock drivers including DS1302, BQ4845
* OSes: CP/M 2.2, ZSDOS, CP/M 3, NZ-COM, ZPM3, QPM, p-System, and FreeRTOS
* Built-in VT-100 terminal emulation support

RomWBW is distributed as both source code and pre-built ROM and disk
images. Some of the provided software can be launched directly from the
ROM firmware itself:

* System Monitor
* Operating Systems (CP/M 2.2, ZSDOS)
* ROM BASIC (Nascom BASIC and Tasty BASIC)
* ROM Forth

A dynamic disk drive letter assignment mechanism allows mapping
operating system drive letters to any available disk media.
Additionally, mass storage devices (IDE Disk, CF Card, SD Card) support
the use of multiple slices (up to 256 per device). Each slice contains
a complete CP/M filesystem and can be mapped independently to any
drive letter. This overcomes the inherent size limitations in legacy
OSes and allows up to 2GB of accessible storage on a single device.

The pre-built ROM firmware images are generally suitable for most
users. However, it is also very easy to modify and build custom ROM
images that fully tailor the firmware to your specific preferences.
All tools required to build custom ROM firmware under Windows are
included -- no need to install assemblers, etc.  The firmware can also
be built using Linux or MacOS after confirming a few standard tools
have been installed.

Multiple disk images are provided in the distribution. Most disk
images contain a complete, bootable, ready-to-run implementation of a
specific operating system. A "combo" disk image contains multiple
slices, each with a full operating system implementation. If you use
this disk image, you can easily pick whichever operating system you
want to boot without changing media.

By design, RomWBW isolates all of the hardware specific functions in
the ROM chip itself.  The ROM provides a hardware abstraction layer
such that all of the operating systems and applications on a disk
will run on any RomWBW-based system.  To put it simply, you can take
a disk (or CF/SD Card) and move it between systems transparently.

A tool is provided that allows you to access a FAT-12/16/32 filesystem. 
The FAT filesystem may be coresident on the same disk media as RomWBW 
slices or on stand-alone media.  This makes exchanging files with modern
OSes such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux very easy.

# Getting Started

## Acquiring RomWBW

The [RomWBW Repository](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW) on GitHub is
the official distribution location for all project source and
documentation.  The fully-built distribution releases are available on
the [RomWBW Releases Page](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases)
of the repository.  On this page, you will normally see a Development
Snapshot as well as recent stable releases. Unless you have a specific
reason, I suggest you stick to the most recent stable release. Expand
the "Assets" drop-down for the release you want to download, then select
the asset named RomWBW-vX.X.X-Package.zip. The Package asset includes
all pre-built ROM and Disk images as well as full source code. The other
assets contain only source code and do not have the pre-built ROM or
disk images.

All source code and distributions are maintained on GitHub. Code
contributions are very welcome.

#### Distribution Directory Layout

The RomWBW distribution is a compressed zip archive file organized in
a set of directories. Each of these directories has its own
ReadMe.txt file describing the contents in detail. In summary, these
directories are:

| **Directory**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Binary**      | The final output files of the build process are placed here. Most importantly, the ROM images with the file names ending in ".rom" and disk images ending in .img. |
| **Doc**         | Contains various detailed documentation, both RomWBW specifically as well as the operating systems and applications.                                               |
| **Source**      | Contains the source code files used to build the software and ROM images.                                                                                          |
| **Tools**       | Contains the programs that are used by the build process or that may be useful in setting up your system.                                                          |

## Installation

In general, installation of RomWBW on your platform is very simple. You
just need to program your ROM with the correct ROM image from the RomWBW
distribution.  Subsequently, you can write disk images on your disk
drives (IDE disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.) which then provides even more
functionality.

The pre-built ROM images will automatically detect and support typical
devices for their corresponding platform including serial ports, video
adapters, on-board disk interfaces, and PropIO/ParPortProp boards
without building a custom ROM. The distribution is a .zip archive. After
downloading it to a working directory on your modern computer
(Windows/Linux/Mac) use any zip tool to extract the contents of the
archive.

Depending on how you got your hardware, you may have already been
provided with a pre-programmed ROM chip. If so, use that initially.
Otherwise, you will need to use a ROM programmer to initially program
your ROM chip. Please refer to the documentation that came with your ROM
programmer for more information. Once you have a running RomWBW system,
you can generally update your ROM to a newer version in-situ with the
included ROM Flashing tool (Will Sowerbutts' FLASH application) as
described in the Upgrading section of this document.

The Binary directory of the distribution contains the pre-built ROM and
disk images. The ROM image files all end in ".rom". Based on the table
below, **carefully** pick the appropriate ROM image for your hardware.

| **Description**                                                | **Bus** | **ROM Image File** | **Baud Rate** |

RCBus refers to Spencer Owen's RC2014 bus specification and derivatives
including RC26, RC40, RC80, and BP80.

Additional information for each of the system configurations supported
by the ROM images listed above is found in
[Appendix A - Pre-built ROM Images].

The RCBus Z180 & Z280 require a separate RAM/ROM memory module. There 
are two types of these modules and you must pick the correct ROM for 
your type of memory module.  The first option is the same as the 512K 
RAM/ROM module for RC/BP80 Bus.  This is called external ("ext") because
the bank switching is performed externally from the CPU.  The second 
type of RAM/ROM module has no bank switching logic -- this is called 
native ("nat") because the CPU itself provides the bank switching logic.
Only Z180 and Z280 CPUs have the ability to do bank switching in the 
CPU, so the ext/nat selection only applies to them.  Z80 CPUs have no 
built-in bank switching logic, so they are always configured for 
external bank switching.

All pre-built ROM images are pure binary files (they are not "hex"
files).  They are intended to be programmed starting at the very start
of the ROM chip (address 0).  Most of the pre-built images are
512KB in size.  If your system utilizes a larger ROM, you can just
program the image into the first 512KB of the ROM for now.

Initially, don't worry about trying to write a disk image to any disk 
(or CF/SD) devices you have.  This will be covered later.  You will be 
able to boot and check out your system with just the ROM.

Connect a serial terminal or computer with terminal emulation software 
to the primary serial port of your CPU board. You may need to refer to 
your hardware provider's documentation for details. A null-modem 
connection may be required. Set the baud rate as indicated in the table 
above. Set the line characteristics to 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no 
parity, and no flow control. If possible, select ANSI or VT-100 terminal
emulation.

RomWBW will automatically attempt to detect and support typical add-on
components for each of the systems supported. More information on the
required system configuration and optional supported components for
each ROM is found in [Appendix A - Pre-built ROM Images].

## System Startup

Upon power-up, your terminal should display a sign-on banner within 2
seconds followed by hardware inventory and discovery information. When
hardware initialization is completed, a boot loader prompt allows you to
choose a ROM-based operating system, system monitor, application, or boot
from a disk device.

Here is an example of a fairly typical startup.  Your system will have
different devices and configuration, but the startup should look
similar.

```
RomWBW HBIOS v3.1.1-pre.183, 2022-10-04

RCBus [RCZ80_kio] Z80 @ 7.372MHz
0 MEM W/S, 1 I/O W/S, INT MODE 2, Z2 MMU

Disk 5      PPIDE1:     Hard Disk         --
```

If your system completes the ROM-based boot process successfully, you
should see the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  For example:

```
RCBus [RCZ80_kio] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

If you get to this prompt, your system has completed the boot process
and is ready to accept commands.  Note that the Boot Loader is not
an operating system or application.  It is essentially the point where
you choose which operating system or application you want RomWBW to
execute.

The Boot Loader is explained in detail in the next section.  For now,
you can try a few simple commands to confirm that you can interact
with the system.

At the Boot Loader prompt, you can type `H <enter>` for help.  You
can type `L <enter>` to list the available built-in ROM applications.
If your terminal supports ANSI escape sequences, you can try the
'G' command to play a simple on-screen game.

If all of this seems fine, your ROM has been successfully programmed.
See the [Boot Loader Operation] section of this document for further
instructions on use of the Boot Loader.

## Core System Information

During startup, the first few lines of information displayed provide the
most basic information on your system.  In the example above, these
lines are the Core System Information:

```
RomWBW HBIOS v3.1.1-pre.183, 2022-10-04

RCBus [RCZ80_kio] Z80 @ 7.372MHz
0 MEM W/S, 1 I/O W/S, INT MODE 2, Z2 MMU
512KB ROM, 512KB RAM
ROM VERIFY: 00 00 00 00 PASS
```

The first line is a version identification banner for RomWBW.  After
that you see a group of 4 lines describing the basic system.  In this
example, the platform is the RCBus running a configuration named
"RCZ80_kio".  The CPU is a Z80 with a current clock speed of 7.372 MHz.
There are 0 memory wait states and 1 I/O wait state.  Z80 interrupt mode
2 is active and the bank memory manager is type "Z2" which is standard
for RCBus.  The system has 512KB of ROM total and 512KB of RAM total.
Finally, a verification of the checksum of the critical ROM banks is
shown (all 4 should be 00).

RomWBW attempts to detect the running configuration of the
system at startup.  Depending on your hardware, there may be
inaccuracies in this section.  For example, in some cases the CPU clock
speed is assumed rather than actually measured.  This does not generally
affect the operation of your system.  If you want to correct any of the
information displayed, you can create a custom ROM which is described
later.

## Hardware Discovery

The next set of messages during boot show the hardware devices as
they are probed and initially configured.  In the example above, these
lines are:

```
KIO: IO=0x80 ENABLED
CTC: IO=0x84 TIMER MODE=TIM16
AY: MODE=RCZ80 IO=0xD8 NOT PRESENT
SIO0: IO=0x89 SIO MODE=115200,8,N,1
SIO1: IO=0x8B SIO MODE=115200,8,N,1
DSRTC: MODE=STD IO=0xC0 NOT PRESENT
MD: UNITS=2 ROMDISK=384KB RAMDISK=256KB
FD: MODE=RCWDC IO=0x50 NOT PRESENT
IDE: IO=0x10 MODE=RC
IDE0: NO MEDIA
IDE1: NO MEDIA
PPIDE: IO=0x20
PPIDE0: LBA BLOCKS=0x00773800 SIZE=3815MB
PPIDE1: NO MEDIA
```

What you see will depend on your specific system and ROM, but should
match the hardware present in your system.  Each device has a tag that
precedes the colon.  This tag identifies the driver and instance of each
device.  For example, the tag "SIO0:" refers to the SIO serial port
driver and specifically the first channel.  The "SIO1:" tag refers to
the second channel.

In many cases you will see IO=0xNN in the data following the tag.  This
identifies the base I/O port address of the hardware device and is
useful for identifying hardware conflicts.

Note that you may see some lines indicating that the associated
hardware is not present.  Above, you can see that the FD driver
did not find a floppy interface.  Lines such as these are completely
normal when your system does not have the associated hardware.

Finally, be aware that all ROMs are configured to identify specific
hardware devices at specific port addresses.  If you add hardware
to your system that is not automatically identified, you may need
to build a custom ROM to add support for it.  Building a custom ROM
is covered later.

[Appendix B - Device Summary] contains a list of the RomWBW hardware
devices which may help you identify the hardware discovered in your
system.

## Device Unit Assignments

In order to support a wide variety of hardware, RomWBW HBIOS uses a
modular approach to implementing device drivers and presenting devices
to an operating system. In general, all devices are classified as
one of the following:

* Disk (RAM/ROM Disk, Floppy Disk, Hard Disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.)
* Character (Serial Ports, Parallel Ports, etc.)
* Video (Video Display/Keyboard Interfaces)
* Sound (Audio Playback Devices)
* RTC/NVRAM (Real Time Clock, Non-volatile RAM)
* System (Internal Services, e.g. Timer, DMA, etc.)

HBIOS uses the concept of unit numbers to present a generic set of
hardware devices to the operating system. As an example, a typical
system might have a ROM Disk, RAM Disk, Floppy Drives, and Disk
Drives. All of these are considered disk devices and are presented
to the operating system as generic block devices. This means that
each operating system does not need to embed code to interact directly
with all of the different hardware devices -- RomWBW takes care of that.

In the final group of startup messages, a device unit summary table is
displayed so that you can see how the actual hardware devices have
been mapped to unit numbers during startup.

```
Unit        Device      Type              Capacity/Mode
----------  ----------  ----------------  --------------------
Char 0      UART0:      RS-232            38400,8,N,1
Char 1      UART1:      RS-232            38400,8,N,1
Disk 0      MD1:        RAM Disk          384KB,LBA
Disk 1      MD0:        ROM Disk          384KB,LBA
Disk 2      FD0:        Floppy Disk       3.5",DS/HD,CHS
Disk 3      FD1:        Floppy Disk       3.5",DS/HD,CHS
Disk 4      IDE0:       CompactFlash      3815MB,LBA
Disk 5      IDE1:       Hard Disk         --
Disk 6      PRPSD0:     SD Card           1886MB,LBA
Video 0     CVDU0:      CRT               Text,80x25
```

In this example, you can see that the system has a total of 7 Disk
Units numbered 0-6. There are also 2 Character Units and 1 Video
Unit. The table shows the unit numbers assigned to each of the
devices. Notice how the unit numbers are assigned sequentially
regardless of the specific device.

There may or may not be media in the disk devices listed. For example,
the floppy disk devices (Disk Units 2 & 3) may not have a floppy in
the drive. Also note that Disk Unit 4 shows a disk capacity, but
Disk Unit 5 does not. This is because the PPIDE interface of the
system supports up to two drives, but there is only one actual drive
attached. A unit number is assigned to all available devices
regardless of whether they have actual media installed at boot time.

Note that Character Unit 0 is normally the initial system console.

If your system has an RTC/NVRAM device, it will not be listed in the
unit summary table. Since only a single RTC/NVRAM device can exist in
one system, unit numbers are not required nor used for this type of
device.  Also, System devices are not listed because they are entirely
internal to RomWBW.

# Boot Loader Operation

Once your system has completed the startup process, it presents a
Boot Loader command prompt.  The purpose of the Boot Loader is to
select and launch a desired application or operating system.  It also
has the ability to configure some aspects of system operation.

After starting your system, following the hardware initialization, you
will see the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  Below is an example:

```
Mark IV [MK4_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

From the Boot Loader prompt, you can enter commands to select and launch any of
the RomWBW operating systems or ROM applications.  It also allows you to
manage some basic settings of the system.  To enter a command, just
enter the command followed by ***\<enter\>***.

For example, typing `H<enter>` will display a short command summary:

```
Boot [H=Help]: h

  L           - List ROM Applications
  D           - Disk Device Inventory
  R           - Reboot System
  I <u> [<c>] - Set Console Interface/Baud code
  V [<n>]     - View/Set HBIOS Diagnostic Verbosity
  <u>[.<s>]   - Boot Disk Unit/Slice
```

Likewise the `L` command will display the list of ROM Applications that
you can launch right from the Boot Loader:

```
Boot [H=Help]: L

ROM Applications:

  M: Monitor
  Z: Z-System
  C: CP/M 2.2
  F: Forth
  B: BASIC
  T: Tasty BASIC
  P: Play a Game
  N: Network Boot
  X: XModem Flash Updater
  U: User App
```

## Starting Applications from ROM

To start a ROM application you just enter the corresponding letter at
the Boot Loader prompt.  In the following example, we launch the
built-in Microsoft BASIC interpreter.  From within BASIC, we use the
`BYE` command to return to the Boot Loader:

```
Boot [H=Help]: b

Mark IV [MK4_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

The following ROM applications and OSes are available at the boot loader
prompt:

| **Application**   | **Description**                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monitor           | Z80 system debug monitor w/ Intel Hex loader                   |
| CP/M 2.2          | Digital Research CP/M 2.2 OS                                   |
| Z-System          | ZSDOS 1.1 w/ ZCPR 1 (Enhanced CP/M compatible OS)              |
| Forth             | Brad Rodriguez's ANSI compatible Forth language                |
| Tasty&nbsp;BASIC  | Dimitri Theuling's Tiny BASIC implementation                   |
| Play              | A simple video game (requires ANSI terminal emulation)         |
| Network&nbsp;Boot | Boot system via Wiznet MT011 device                            |
| Flash&nbsp;Update | Upload and flash a new ROMWBW image using xmodem               |

Each of the ROM Applications is documented in $doc_romapps$.  Some
of the applications (such as BASIC) also have their own independent
manual in the Doc directory of the distribution.  The OSes included
in the ROM (CP/M 2.2 & Z-System) are described in the Operating Systems
section of this document.

In general, the command to exit any of these applications and restart
the system is `BYE`. The exceptions are the Monitor which uses `B` and
Play which uses `Q`.

Two of the ROM Applications are, in fact, complete operating systems.
Specifically, "CP/M 2.2" and "Z-System" are provided so that you can
actually start either operating system directly from your ROM.  This
technique is useful when:

* You don't yet have any real disk drives in your system
* You want to setup real disk drives for the first time
* You are upgrading your system and need to upgrade your real disk drives

The RAM disk and ROM disk drives will be available even if you have
no physical disk devices attached to your system.

## Starting Operating Systems from Disk

In order to make use of the more sophisticated operating systems
available with RomWBW, you will need to boot an operating system
from a disk.  Setting up disks is described in detail later.  For now,
we will just go over the command line for performing this type of boot.

From the Boot Loader prompt, you can enter a number (***\<diskunit\>***)
and optionally a dot followed by a second number (***\<slice\>***).  The
***\<disk unit\>*** unit number refers to a disk unit that was displayed
when the system was booted -- essentially it specifies the specific
physical disk drive you want to boot.  The ***\<slice\>*** numbers refers
to a portion of the disk unit to boot.  If no slice is specified, then
it is equivalent to booting from the first slice (slice 0).  Disk units
and slices are described in more detail later.

Following this, you should see the operating system startup
messages. Your operating system prompt will typically be `A>` and
when you look at the drive letter assignments, you should see that A:
has been assigned to the disk and slice you selected to boot.

If you receive the error message "Disk not bootable!", you have
either failed to properly initialize the disk and slice requested
or you have selected the wrong disk/slice.

The following example shows a disk boot into the first slice of disk
unit 4 which happens to be the CP/M 2.2 operating system on this disk.
This is accomplished by entering just the number '4' and pressing
***\<enter\>***.

```
Boot [H=Help]: 4

Notice that a list of drive letters and their assignments to RomWBW
devices and slices is displayed during the initialization of the
operating system.

Here is another example where we are booting disk unit 4, slice 3
which is the CP/M 3 operating system on this disk:

```
Boot [H=Help]: 4.3

Some operating systems (such as CP/M 3 shown above) do not list the
drive assignments during initialization.  In this case, you can use the
`ASSIGN` command to display the current assignments.

The Boot Loader simply launches whatever is in the disk unit/slice you
have specified.  It does not know what operating system is at that
location.  The layout of operating systems on disk media is described in
the Using Disks section of this document.

## System Management

### Listing Disk Device Inventory

The disk device units available in your system are listed in the
boot messages.  However, if that list has scrolled off of your
screen, you can use the 'D' command to display a list of them at
any time from the Boot Loader prompt.

```
Boot [H=Help]: d

Disk Devices:

  Disk Unit 0 on MD0:
  Disk Unit 1 on MD1:
  Disk Unit 2 on FD0:
  Disk Unit 3 on FD1:
  Disk Unit 4 on IDE0:
  Disk Unit 5 on IDE1:
  Disk Unit 6 on IDE2:
  Disk Unit 7 on IDE3:
  Disk Unit 8 on IDE4:
  Disk Unit 9 on IDE5:
  Disk Unit 10 on SD0:
  Disk Unit 11 on PRPSD0:
```

### Rebooting the System

The 'R' command within the Boot Loader performs a software reset of
the system.  It is the software equivalent of pressing the reset
button.

There is generally no need to do this, but it can be convenient when
you want to see the boot messages again or ensure your system is in
a clean state.

```
Boot [H=Help]: r

Restarting System...
```

### Changing Console and Console speed

Your system can support a number of devices for the console. They may
be VDU type devices or serial devices. If you want to change which
device is the console, the ***I*** menu option can be used to choose
the unit and its speed.

The command format is ```I <unit> [<baudrate>]```

where ***\<unit\>*** is the character unit to select and ***\<baudrate\>***
is the optional baud rate.

Supported baud rates are:
```
 75   450  1800   7200  38400  115200   460800  1843200
150   600  2400   9600  28800  153600   614400  2457600
225   900  3600  14400  57600  230400   921600  3686400
300  1200  4800  19200  76800  307200  1228800  7372800
```

Here is an example of changing the console to unit #1 (the second
serial port) and switching the port to 9600 baud:

```
Boot [H=Help]: i 1 9600

  Change speed now. Press a key to resume.

  Console on Unit #1
```

At this point, the Boot Loader prompt will be displayed on character
unit #1.

Note that not all character devices support changing baud rates and
some only support a limited subset of the baud rates listed.  If you
attempt to select an invalid baud rate for your system, you will get
an error message.

### HBIOS Diagnostic Verbosity

The 'V' command of the Boot Loader allows you to view and optionally
change the level of diagnostic messages that RomWBW will produce.
The normal verbosity level is 4, which means to display only fatal
errors.  You can increase this level to see more warnings when function
calls to RomWBW HBIOS detect problems.

The use of diagnostic levels above 4 are really intended only for
software developers.  I do not recommend changing this under
normal circumstances.

## Front Panel

RomWBW supports the concept of a simple front panel.  The following 
image is a conceptual view of such a front panel.  If your system has a 
front panel, it should look similar to the [RomWBW Front Panel](#panel).

![RomWBW Front Panel](Graphics/Panel){#panel width=50% }

The LEDs in the top row of the panel are used for multiple purposes.
They are initially used to display the progress of the
system boot.  This may help in diagnosing a hardware or configuration
issue in a system that does not progress far enough to display text
output on the console.  The meaning of the LEDs is:

|            |                              |
|------------|------------------------------|
| `O-------` | System Boot has started      |
| `OO------` | Common RAM bank activated    |
| `OOO-----` | HBIOS transitioned to RAM    |
| `OOOO----` | Basic initialization done    |
| `OOOOO---` | CPU detection complete       |
| `OOOOOO--` | System timer configured      |
| `OOOOOOO-` | Pre-console device init done |
| `OOOOOOOO` | Console activation           |

Once the system has booted, the LEDs are used to indicate disk device
activity.  Each LED numbered 7-0 represents disk units 7-0.  As each
disk device performs I/O, the LED will light.

The second row of the front panel is composed of switches that allow
you to control a few aspects of the system startup.

The first two switches affect the device used as the console initially.
Setting the CRT/Serial switch will cause the system to boot directly 
to an attached CRT device (if available).  Setting the Pri/Sec switch 
will cause the system to boot to the secondary Serial or CRT device 
(depending on the setting of the first switch).

The final six switches allow you to cause the system to automatically
boot into a desired function.  The Auto/Menu switch must be set to
enable this, otherwise the normal ROM Loader prompt will be used.
If the Disk/ROM switch is not set, then you can use the last 3
switches to select a ROM app to auto-start.  If the Disk/ROM switch is
set, then the system will attempt a disk boot based on the following
switches.  The Floppy/Hard switch can be used to boot to a Floppy or
Hard Disk.  In either case, the first Floppy or Hard Disk will be used
for the boot.  If a Hard Disk boot is selected, then the last three
switches can be used to select any of the first 8 slices.

# Disk Management

The systems supported by RomWBW all have the ability to use persistent
disk media. A wide variety of disk devices are supported including
floppy drives, hard disks, CF Cards, and SD Cards.  RomWBW also
supports the use of extra RAM and ROM memory as pseudo-disk devices.

RomWBW supports a variety of storage devices which will be discussed
in more detail later.

* ROM Disk
* RAM Disk
* Floppy Disk
* Hard Disk (includes CF Cards and SD Cards)

We will start by discussing each of these types of storage devices and
how to prepare them so files can be stored on them.  Subsequently, we
will describe how to install the pre-built disk images with bootable
operating systems and ready-to-run content.

Some systems have disk interfaces built-in, while others will require
add-in cards. You will need to refer to the documentation for your
system for your specific options.

In the RomWBW boot messages, you will see hardware discovery messages.
If you have a disk drive interface, you should see messages listing
device types like FD:, IDE:, PPIDE:, SD:. Additionally, you will see
messages indicating the media that has been found on the interfaces.
As an example, here are the messages you might see if you have an IDE
interface in your system with a single CF Card inserted in the
primary side of the interface:

```
IDE: IO=0x80 MODE=MK4
IDE0: 8-BIT LBA BLOCKS=0x00773800 SIZE=3815MB
IDE1: NO MEDIA
```

The messages you see will vary depending on your hardware and the
media you have installed. But, they will all have the same general
format as the example above.

Once your system has working disk devices, they will be accessible
from any operating system you choose to run.  Disk storage is available
whether you boot your OS from ROM or from the disk media itself.

Referring back to the Boot Loader section on "Launching from ROM", you
could start CP/M 2.2 using the 'C' command.  As the operating system
starts up, you should see a list of drive letters assigned to the disk
media you have installed. Here is an example of this:

```
Configuring Drives...

   A:=MD1:0
   B:=MD0:0
   C:=IDE0:0
   D:=IDE0:1
```

You will probably see more drive letters than this. The drive letter
assignment process is described below in the Drive Letter Assignment
section. Be aware that RomWBW will only assign drive letters to disk
interfaces that actually have media in them. If you do not see drive
letters assigned as expected, refer to the prior system boot messages
to ensure media has been detected in the interface. Actually, there
is one exception to this rule: floppy drives will be assigned a drive
letter regardless of whether there is any media inserted at boot.

Notice how each drive letter refers back to a specific disk hardware
interface like IDE0. This is important as it is telling you what each
drive letter refers to. Also notice that mass storage disks (like IDE)
will normally have multiple drive letters assigned. The extra drive
letters refer to additional "slices" on the disk. The concept of slices
is described below in the Slices section.

## Drive Letter Assignment

In legacy CP/M-type operating systems, drive letters were generally
mapped to disk drives in a completely fixed way. For example, drive A:
would **always** refer to the first floppy drive. Since RomWBW
supports a wide variety of hardware configurations, it implements a
much more flexible drive letter assignment mechanism so that any drive
letter can be assigned to any disk device.

At boot, you will notice that RomWBW automatically assigns drive
letters to the available disk devices. These assignments are
displayed during the startup of the selected operating system.
Additionally, you can review the current drive assignments at any
time using the `ASSIGN` command. CP/M 3 and ZPM3 do not automatically
display the assignments at startup, but you can use `ASSIGN` to
display them.  Refer to $doc_apps$ for more information on
use of the `ASSIGN` command.

Here is an example of the list of drive letter assignments made during
the startup of Z-System:

```
Loading Z-System...

CBIOS v3.1.1-pre.194 [WBW]

Formatting RAMDISK...

Configuring Drives...

        A:=MD0:0
        B:=MD1:0
        C:=FD0:0
        D:=FD1:0
        E:=IDE0:0
        F:=IDE0:1
        G:=IDE0:2
        H:=IDE0:3

        1081 Disk Buffer Bytes Free

ZSDOS v1.1, 54.0K TPA
```

Above you can see that drive A: has been assigned to MD0 which is the
RAM Disk device.  Drives C: and D: have been assigned to floppy drives.
Drives E: thru L: have been assigned to the IDE0 hard disk device.  The
4 entries for IDE0 are referring to 4 slices on that disk.  Slices are
discussed later.

The drive letter assignments **do not** change during an OS session
unless you use the `ASSIGN` command yourself to do it. Additionally,
the assignments at boot will stay the same on each boot as long as you
do not make changes to your hardware configuration. Note that the
assignments **are** dependent on the media currently inserted in hard
disk drives. So, notice that if you insert or remove an SD Card or CF
Card, the drive assignments will change. Since drive letter
assignments can change, you must be careful when doing destructive
things like using `CLRDIR` to make sure the drive letter you use is
referring to the desired media.

When performing a ROM boot of an operating system, note that A: will
be your RAM disk and B: will be your ROM disk. When performing a disk
boot, the disk you are booting from will be assigned to A: and the
rest of the drive letters will be offset to accommodate this. This is
done because most legacy operating systems expect that A: will be the
boot drive.

## ROM & RAM Disks

A typical RomWBW system has 512KB of ROM and 512KB of RAM.  Some
portions of each are dedicated to loading and running applications
and operating system.  The space left over is available for an
operating system to use as a pseudo-disk device.

The RAM disk provides a small CP/M filesystem that you can use for the
temporary storage of files. Unless your system has a battery backed
mechanism for persisting your RAM contents, the RAM disk contents will
be lost at each power-off. However, the RAM disk is an excellent
choice for storing temporary files because it is very fast.  You will
notice that the first time an operating system is started after the
power was turned off, you will see a message indicating that the
RAM disk is being formatted.  If you reset your system without
turning off power, the RAM disk will not be reformatted and it's
contents will still be intact.

Like the RAM disk, the ROM disk also provides a small CP/M
filesystem, but it's contents are static -- they are part of the
ROM. As such, you cannot save files to the ROM disk. Any attempt to
do this will result in a disk I/O error. The contents of the ROM
disk have been chosen to provide a core set of tools and
applications that are helpful for either CP/M 2.2 or ZSDOS. Since
ZSDOS is CP/M 2.2 compatible, this works fairly well. However, you
will find some files on the ROM disk that will work with ZSDOS, but
will not work on CP/M 2.2. For example, `LDDS`, which loads the
ZSDOS date/time stamper will only run under ZSDOS.

Unlike other types of disk devices, ROM and RAM Disks do not contain an
actual operating system and are not "bootable".  However, they are
accessible to any operating system (whether the operating system is
loaded from ROM or a different disk device).

Neither RAM not ROM disks require explicit formatting or initialization.
ROM disks are pre-formatted and RAM disks are formatted automatically
with an empty directory when first used.

#### Flash ROM Disks

The limitation of ROM disks being read only can be overcome on some
platforms with the appropriate selection of Flash ROM chip and
system configuration. In this case the flash-file system can be
enabled which will allow the ROM disk to be read and written to.
Flash devices have a limited write lifespan and continual usage will
eventually wear out the device. It is not suited for high usage
applications.  Enabling ROM disk writing requires building a
custom ROM.

## Floppy Disks

If your system has the appropriate hardware, RomWBW will support the use
of floppy disks.  The supported floppy disk formats are generally
derived from the IBM PC floppy disk formats:

* 5.25" 360K Double-sided, Double-density
* 5.25" 1.2M Double-sided, High-density
* 3.5" 720K Double-sided, Double-density
* 3.5" 1.44M Double-sided, High-density

When supported, RomWBW is normally configured for 2 3.5" floppy drives.
If a high-density drive is used, then RomWBW automatically detects and
adapts to double-density or high-density media.  It cannot automatically
detect 3.5" vs. 5.25" drive types -- the ROM must be pre-configured
for the drive type.

Floppy media must be physically formatted before it can be used.  This
is normally accomplished by using the supplied Floppy Disk Utility (FDU)
application.  This application interacts directly with your hardware
and therefore you must specify your floppy interface hardware at startup.
Additionally, you need to specify the floppy drive and media format to
use for formatting.

Below is a sample session using FDU to format a 1.44M floppy disk in
the first (primary) floppy disk drive:

```

Since the physical format of floppy media is the same as that used
in a standard MS-DOS/Windows computer, you can also physical format
floppy media in a modern computer.  However, the directory format
itself will not be compatible with CP/M OSes.  In this case, you
can use the `CLRDIR` application supplied with RomWBW to reformat
the directory area.

Once a floppy disk is formatted, you can read/write files on it
using any of the RomWBW operating systems.  The specific commands
will depend on the operating system or application in use -- refer to
the appropriate OS/application documentation as needed.

**WARNING:** Some of the operating systems provided with RomWBW require
that a soft-reset be performed when swapping floppy disk media.  For
example, under CP/M 2.2, you must press control-C at the CP/M prompt
after inserting a new floppy disk.

## Hard Disks

Under RomWBW, a hard disk is similar to a floppy disk in that it is
considered a disk unit.  However, RomWBW has multiple features that
allow its legacy operating systems to take advantage of modern
mass storage media.

To start with, the concept of a hard disk in RomWBW applies to any
storage device that provides at least 8MB of space.  The actual
media can be a real spinning hard disk, a CompactFlash Card, a
SD Card, etc.  In this document, the term hard disk will apply
equally to all of these.

RomWBW uses Logical Block Addressing (LBA) to interact with all hard
disks.  The RomWBW operating systems use older Cylinder/Head/Sector
(CHS) addressing.  To accommodate the operating systems, RomWBW emulates
CHS addressing.  Specifically, it makes all hard disks look like they
have 16 sectors and 16 heads.  The number of tracks varies with the size
of the physical hard disk.

It is recommended that hard disk media used with RomWBW be 1GB or
greater in capacity.  The reasons for this are discussed later, but it
allows you to use the recommended disk layout for RomWBW that
accommodates 64 CP/M filesystem slices and a 384KB FAT filesystem.

>>> handles disk devices as background.  The following sections explain how
>>> disk units are managed within the operating systems.  We will
>>> subsequently discuss how to actually setup disk devices with usable
>>> content.

## Slices

The vintage operating systems included with RomWBW were produced at a
time when mass storage devices were quite small. CP/M 2.2 could only
handle filesystems up to 8MB. In order to achieve compatibility across
all of the operating systems supported by RomWBW, the hard disk
filesystem format used is 8MB. This ensures any filesystem will be
accessible to any of the operating systems.

Since storage devices today are quite large, RomWBW implements a
mechanism called slicing to allow up to 256 8MB filesystems on a
single large storage device. This allows up to 2GB of usable space on
one media. You can think of slices as a way to refer to any of
the first 256 8MB chunks of space on a single media.

Note that although you can use up to 256 slices per physical disk, this
large number of slices is rarely used.  The recommended RomWBW disk
layout provides for 64 slices which is more than enough for most
use cases.

Of course, the problem is that CP/M-like operating systems have only
16 drive letters (A:-P:) available. Under the covers, RomWBW allows
you to use any drive letter to refer to any slice of any media. The
`ASSIGN` command is used to view or change the current drive letter
mappings at any time. At startup, the operating system will
automatically allocate a reasonable number of drive letters to the
available storage devices. The allocation will depend on the number of
mass storage devices available at boot. For example, if you have
only one hard disk type media, you will see that 8 drive letters are
assigned to the first 8 slices of that media. If you have two large
storage devices, you will see that each device is allocated four drive
letters.

Referring to slices within a storage device is done by appending a :
*<n>* where *<n>* is the device relative slice number from 0-255. For
example, if you have an IDE device, it will show up as IDE0: in the
boot messages meaning the first IDE device. To refer to the fourth
slice of IDE0, you would type "IDE0:3". Here are some examples:

|          |                              |
|----------|------------------------------|
| `IDE0:0` | First slice of disk in IDE0  |
| `IDE0:`  | First slice of disk in IDE0  |
| `IDE0:3` | Fourth slice of disk in IDE0 |

So, if you wanted to use drive letter L: to refer to the fourth slice
of IDE0, you could use the command `ASSIGN L:=IDE0:3`. There are a
couple of rules to be aware of when assigning drive letters. First,
you may only refer to a specific device/slice with one drive letter at a time.
Said another way, you cannot have multiple drive letters referring
to a the same device/slice at the same time. Second, there must always
be a drive assigned to A:. Any attempt to violate these rules will
be blocked by the `ASSIGN` command.

In case this wasn't already clear, you **cannot** refer directly
to slices using CP/M.  CP/M only understands drive letters, so
to access a given slice, you must assign a drive letter to it first.

While it may be obvious, you cannot use slices on any media less
than 8MB in size. Specifically, you cannot slice RAM disks, ROM
disks, floppy disks, etc.  All of these are considered to have a single
slice and any attempt to ASSIGN a drive letter to a slice beyond that
will result in an error message.

It is very important to understand that RomWBW slices are not
individually created or allocated on your hard disk.  RomWBW uses a
single, large chunk of space on your hard disk to contain the slices.
You should think of slices as just an index into a sequential set of 8MB
areas that exist in this large chunk of space.  The next section will
go into more detail on how slices are located on your hard disk.

Although you do not need to allocate slices individually, you do need to
initialize each slice for CP/M to use it.  This is somewhat analogous
to doing a FORMAT operation on other systems.  With RomWBW you use the
`CLRDIR` command to do this. This command is merely "clearing out" the
directory space of the slice referred to by a drive letter and setting
up the new empty directory.  Since `CLRDIR` works on drive letters, make
absolutely sure you know what media and slice are assigned to that
drive letter before using `CLRDIR` because CLRDIR will wipe out any
pre-existing contents of the slice.

Here is an example of using `CLRDIR`.  In this example, the `ASSIGN`
command is used to show the current drive letter assignments.  Then
the `CLRDIR` command is used to initialize the directory of drive 'G'
which is slice 2 of hard disk device IDE0 ("IDE0:2").

```
B>assign

   A:=MD0:0
   B:=MD1:0
   C:=FD0:0
   D:=FD1:0
   E:=IDE0:0
   F:=IDE0:1
   G:=IDE0:2
   H:=IDE0:3

B>clrdir G:
CLRDIR Version 1.2 April 2020 by Max Scane

Warning - this utility will overwrite the directory sectors of Drive: G
Type Y to proceed, any key other key to exit. Y
Directory cleared.
B>
```

## Hard Disk Layouts

As previously discussed, when RomWBW uses a hard disk, it utilizes a
chunk of space for a sequential series of slices that contain the
actual CP/M filesystems referred to by drive letters.

Originally, RomWBW always used the very start of the hard disk media
for the location of the slices.  In this layout, slice 0 referred to
the first chunk of ~8MB on the disk, slice 1 referred to the second
chunk of ~8MB on the disk, and so on.  The number of slices is limited
to the size of the disk media -- if you attempted to read/write to a
slice that would exceed the disk size, you would see I/O errors.  This
is considered the "legacy" disk layout for RomWBW.

RomWBW has subsequently been enhanced to support the concept of
partitioning.  The partition mechanism is entirely compliant with Master
 Boot Record (MBR) Partition Tables introduced by IBM for the PC.  The
Wikipedia article on the
[Master Boot Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record)
is excellent if you are not familiar with them.  This is considered the
"modern" disk layout for RomWBW.  RomWBW uses the partition type id
0x2E.  RomWBW does not support extended partitions -- only a single
primary partition can be used.

Both the legacy and modern disk layouts continue to be fully supported
by RomWBW.  There are no plans to deprecate the legacy layout.  In fact,
the legacy format takes steps to allow a partition table to still be
used for other types of filesystems such as DOS/FAT.  It just does not
use a partition table entry to determine the start of the RomWBW slices.

There is one more difference between the legacy and modern disk layouts
that should be highlighted.  The CP/M filesystem in the slices of
the legacy disk layout contain 512 directory entries.  The modern disk
layout filesystems provide 1024 directory entries.  In fact, you will
subsequently see that the prefixes "hd512" and "hd1k" are used to
identify disk images appropriate for the legacy and modern format.

You **cannot** mix disk layouts on a single disk device.  To say it
another way, the existence of a partition table entry for RomWBW on
a hard disk makes it behave in the modern mode.  The lack of a RomWBW
partition table entry will cause legacy behavior.  Adding a partition
table entry on an existing legacy RomWBW hard disk will cause the
existing data to be unavailable and/or corrupted.  Likewise, removing
the RomWBW partition entry from a modern hard disk layout will cause
the same problems.  It is perfectly fine for one system to have
multiple hard disks with different layouts -- each physical disk
device is handled separately.

If you are setting up a new disk, the modern (hd1k) layout is
recommended for the following reasons:

* Larger number of directory entries per filesystem
* Simplifies creation of coresident FAT filesystem
* Reduces chances of data corruption

### Checking Hard Disk Layout

If you are not sure which hard disk layout was used for your existing
media, you can use the CP/M `STAT` command to determine this.  This
command displays the number of directory entries on a filesystem.  If
it indicates 512, your disk layout is legacy (hd512).  If it indicates
1024, your disk layout is modern (hd1k).

Here is an example of checking the disk layout.  We want to check the
CompactFlash Card inserted in IDE interface 0.  We start the system
and boot to Z-System in ROM by using the 'Z' command at the Boot Loader.
As Z-System starts, we see the following disk assignments:

```
Boot [H=Help]: z

Loading Z-System...

CBIOS v3.1.1-pre.194 [WBW]

Configuring Drives...

        A:=MD0:0
        B:=MD1:0
        C:=FD0:0
        D:=FD1:0
        E:=IDE0:0
        F:=IDE0:1
        G:=IDE0:2
        H:=IDE0:3
        I:=PRPSD0:0
        J:=PRPSD0:1
        K:=PRPSD0:2
        L:=PRPSD0:3

        1081 Disk Buffer Bytes Free

ZSDOS v1.1, 54.0K TPA
```

You can see that the IDE0 interface (which contains the CF Card) has
been assigned to drive letters E: to H:.  We can use the STAT command
on any of these drive letters.  So, for example:

```
B>stat e:dsk:

    E: Drive Characteristics
65408: 128 Byte Record Capacity
 8176: Kilobyte Drive  Capacity
 1024: 32  Byte Directory Entries
    0: Checked  Directory Entries
  256: Records/ Extent
   32: Records/ Block
   64: Sectors/ Track
    2: Reserved Tracks
```

It is critical that you include "dsk:" after the drive letter in the
`STAT` command line.  The important line to look at is labelled "32 Byte
Directory Entries".  In this case, the value is 1024 which implies that
this drive is located on a modern (hd1k) disk layout.  If the value
was 512, it would indicate a legacy (hd512) disk layout.

# Disk Content Preparation

With some understanding of how RomWBW presents disk space to the
operating systems, we need to go over the options for actually setting
up your disk(s) with content.

Since it would be quite a bit of work to transfer over all the files you
might want initially to your disk(s), RomWBW provides a much easier way
to get initial contents on your disks.  You can use your modern
Windows, Linux, or Mac computer to copy a disk image onto the disk
media, then just move the media over to your RomWBW computer. RomWBW
comes with a variety of disk images that are ready to use and have a
much more complete set of files than you will find on the ROM disk. This
process is covered below under [Disk Images].

If you do not want to start with pre-built disk images, you can
alternatively initialize the media in-place using your RomWBW system.
Essentially, this means you are creating a set of blank directories on
your disk so that files can be saved there.  This process is described
below under Disk Initialization. In this scenario, you will need to
subsequently copy any files you want to use onto the newly initialized
disk (see [Transferring Files]).

You will notice that in the following instructions there is no mention
of specific hardware.  Because the RomWBW firmware provides a 
hardware abstraction layer, all disk images will work on all 
hardware variations. Yes, this means you can remove an CF/SD Card from 
one RomWBW system and put it in a different RomWBW system. The only 
constraint is that the applications on the disk media must be up to date
with the firmware on the system being used.

## Disk Images

As mentioned previously, RomWBW includes a variety of disk images
that contain a full set of applications for the operating systems
supported. It is generally easier to use these disk images than
transferring your files over individually. You use your modern
computer (Windows, Linux, MacOS) to write the disk image onto the
disk media, then just move the media over to your system.

The disk image files are found in the Binary directory of the
distribution. Floppy disk images are prefixed with "fd_" and hard
disk images are prefixed with either "hd512_" or "hd1k_" depending on the
hard disk layout they are for.

Each disk image has the complete set of normal applications and tools 
distributed with the associated operating system or application suite.
The following table shows the disk images available.

| **Disk Image**  | **Description**                        | **Boot** |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| xxx_cpm22.img   | DRI CP/M 2.2 Operating System          | Yes      |
| xxx_zsdos.img   | ZCPR-DJ & ZSDOS 1.1 Operating System   | Yes      |
| xxx_nzcom.img   | NZCOM ZCPR 3.4 Operating System        | Yes      |
| xxx_cpm3.img    | DRI CP/M 3 Operating System            | Yes      |
| xxx_zpm3.img    | ZPM3 Operating System                  | Yes      |
| xxx_qpm.img     | QPM Operating System                   | Yes      |
| xxx_dos65.img   | DOS/65 Operating System                | Yes      |
| xxx_ws4.img     | WordStar v4 & ZDE Applications         | No       |

You will find 3 sets of these .img files in the distribution.  The
"xxx" portion of the filename will be "fd_" for a floppy image,
"hd512" for a legacy layout hard disk image, and "hd1K" for a modern
layout hard disk image.

There is also an image file called "psys.img" which contains a bootable 
p-System hard disk image.  It contains 6 p-System filesystem slices, but
these are not interoperable with the CP/M slices described above.  This
file is discussed separately under p-System in the [Operating Systems] 
section.

### Floppy Disk Images

The floppy disk images are all intended to be used with 3.5" high-density,
double-sided 1.44 MB floppy disk media.  This is ideal for the default
floppy drive support included in RomWBW standard ROMs.

For floppy disks, the .img file is written directly to the floppy media 
as is.  The floppy .img files are 1.44 MB which is the exact size of a 
single 3.5" high density floppy disk.  You will need a floppy disk
drive of the same type connected to your modern computer to write this
image.  Although modern computers do not come equipped with a floppy
drive, you can still find USB floppy drives that work well for this.

The floppy disk must be physically formatted **before** writing the
image onto it.  You can do this with RomWBW using FDU as described
in the [Floppy Disks] section of this document.  You can also format
the floppy using your modern computer, but using FDU on RomWBW is
preferable because it will allow you to use optimal physical sector
interleaving.

RomWBW includes a Windows application called RawWriteWin in the Tools 
directory of the distribution.  This simple application will let you 
choose a file and write it to an attached floppy drive. For Linux/MacOS,
I think you can use the dd command (but I have not actually tried 
this).  It is probably obvious, but writing an image to a floppy disk 
will overwrite and destroy all previous contents.

Once the image has been written to the floppy disk, you can insert
the floppy disk in your RomWBW floppy disk and read/write files
on it according to the specific operating system instructions.  If the
image is bootable, then you will be able to boot from it by entering
the floppy drive's corresponding unit number at the RomWBW Boot Loader
command prompt.

### Hard Disk Images

Keeping in mind that a RomWBW hard disk (including CF /SD Cards)
allows you to have multiple slices (CP/M filesystems), there are a
couple ways to image hard disk media.  The easiest approach is to 
use the "combo" disk image.  This image is already prepared
with 6 slices containing 5 ready-to-run OSes and a slice with
the WordStar application.  Alternatively, you can create your own
hard disk image with the specific slice contents you choose.

#### Combo Hard Disk Image

The combo disk image is essentially just a single image that has several
of the individual filesystem images already concatenated together. The 
combo disk image contains the following 6 slices in the positions 
indicated:

| **Slice** | **Description**                                                  |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slice 0   | DRI CP/M 2.2 Operating System                                    |
| Slice 1   | ZCPR-DJ & ZSDOS 1.1 Operating System                             |
| Slice 2   | NZCOM ZCPR 3.4 Operating System                                  |
| Slice 3   | DRI CP/M 3 Operating System                                      |
| Slice 4   | ZPM3 Operating System                                            |
| Slice 5   | WordStar v4 & ZDE Applications                                   |

You will notice that there are actually 2 combo disk images in the 
distribution.  One for an hd512 disk layout (hd512_combo.img) and one 
for an hd1k disk layout (hd1k_combo.img). Simply use the image file that
corresponds to your desired hard disk layout.

#### Custom Hard Disk Image

If you want to use specific slices in a specific order, you can easily
generate a custom hard disk image file.

For hard disks, each .img file represents a single slice (CP/M 
filesystem).  Since a hard disk can contain many slices, you can just 
concatenate the slices (.img files) together to create your desired hard
disk image.  For example, if you want to create a hard disk image that 
has slices for CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3, and WordStar in the hd512 format, you would use 
the command line of your modern computer to create the final image:

Windows:

`COPY /B hd512_cpm22.img + hd512_cpm3.img + hd512_ws hd.img`

Linux/MacOS:

`cat hd512_cpm22.img hd512_cpm3.img hd512_ws >hd.img`

**NOTE:** For the hd1k disk layout, you **must** prepend the 
prefix file called hd1k_prefix.dat which contains the required
partition table.  So, for an hd1k layout you would use the following:

Windows:

`COPY /B hd1k_prefix.dat + hd1k_cpm22.img + hd1k_cpm3.img + hd1k_ws hd.img`

Linux/MacOS:

`cat hd1k_prefix.dat hd1k_cpm22.img hd1k_cpm3.img hd1k_ws >hd.img`

In all of the examples above, the resulting file (hd.img) would now be 
written to your hard disk media and would be ready to use in a RomWBW 
system.

If you wish to further customize or create new disk image definitions,
please refer to the ReadMe.txt file in the Source/Images directory.

#### Writing Hard Disk Images

Once you have chosen a combo hard disk image file or prepared your own 
custom hard disk image file, it will need to be written to the media 
using your modern computer.  Note that you **do not** run `CLRDIR` or 
`SYSCOPY` on the slices that contain the data.  When using this method, 
the disk will be partitioned and setup with 1 or more slices containing 
ready-to-run bootable operating systems.

To write a hard disk image file onto your actual media (actual hard 
disk or CF/SD Card), you need to use an image writing utility on your 
modern computer. Your modern computer will need to have an appropriate 
interface or slot that accepts the media. To actually copy the image, 
you can use the `dd` command on Linux or MacOS. On Windows, in the 
"Tools" directory of the distribution, there is an application called 
Win32DiskImager. In all cases, the image file should be written to the 
media starting at the very first block or sector of the media.

You are not limited to the number of slices that are contained in the 
image that you write to your hard disk media.  You can use additional 
slices as long your media has room for them.  However, writing the disk 
image will not initialize the additional slices.  If these additional 
slices were previously initialized, they will not be corrupted when you 
write the new image and will still contain their previous contents.  If 
the additional slices were not previously initialized, you can use 
`CLRDIR` to do so and optionally `SYSCOPY` if you want them to be 
bootable.

To be entirely clear, writing a disk image file to your hard disk media
will overwrite an pre-existing partition table and the number of slices
that your image file contains.  It will not overwrite or corrupt slices
beyond those in the image file.  As a result, you can use additional
slices as a place to maintain your personal data because these slices
will survive re-imaging of the media.  If you setup a FAT partition
on your media, it will also survive the imaging process.

**WARNING**: In order for your additional slices and/or FAT partition to
survive re-imaging, you **must** follow these rules:

* Do not modify the partition table of the media using FDISK80 or any
  other partition management tools.
* Ensure that your hard disk image file uses the same disk layout
  approach (hd512 or hd1k) as previously used on the media.

Once you have copied the image onto the hard disk media, you can
move the media over to your RomWBW system.  You can then boot to the
operating system slices by specify "<unitnum>.<slicenum>" at the
RomWBW Boot Loader command prompt.

## In-situ Disk Preparation

If you do not wish to use the pre-built disk images, it is entirely
possible to setup your disks manually and transfer contents to them.

In this scenario, you will initialize the disk media entirely from
your RomWBW system.  So, you need to start by inserting the disk
media, booting RomWBW, and confirming that the media is being
recognized.  If RomWBW recognizes the media, it will indicate this
in the boot messages even though the media has not yet been prepared
for use.

The following instructions are one way to proceed.  This does not mean
to imply it is the only possible way.  Also, note that RAM/ROM disk
media is prepared automatically.  ROM disks are part of the ROM image
and RAM disks are initialized when an operating system is started.

Start by booting RomWBW and launching either CP/M 2.2 or Z-System
from ROM using the Boot Loader 'C' or 'Z' commands respectively.  You
can now use the tools on the ROM disk to prepare your disks.  Note
that you will see the operating system assign disks/slices to
drives even though the disks/slices are not yet initialized.  This is
normal and does not mean the disks/slices are ready to use.

Preparation of floppy disk media is very simple.  The floppy disk must 
be physically formatted as discussed in [Floppy Disks] previously using 
`FDU`. If a floppy is already physically formatted, you can wipe out 
it's contents (make it empty again) by running `CLRDIR` on it.  You can 
confirm a floppy disk is ready for content by simply running a `DIR` 
command on it.  The `DIR` command should complete without error and 
should list no files.  At this point, you can  proceed to copy files to 
the floppy disk and (optionally) make the floppy bootable using 
`SYSCOPY`.

The rest of this section will cover preparation of hard disk media.  To
start, it is critical that you decide which disk layout approach to use
(either hd512 or hd1k).  Review the [Hard Disk Layouts] section if you
are not sure.

#### Partition Setup

Since the disk layout is determined by the existence (or lack) of
a RomWBW partition, you must start by running `FDISK80`.  When FDISK80
starts, enter the disk unit number of the new media.  At this point,
use the 'I' command to initialize (reset) the partition table to an
empty state.  If you are going to use the hd512 layout, then use 'W' to
write the empty table to the disk and exit.  Remember that the lack of a
partition for RomWBW implies the legacy (hd512) layout.

If you are going to use an hd1k layout, then you must create a partition
for the RomWBW CP/M slices.  The partition can be placed anywhere you 
want and can be any size >= 8MB.  Keeping the size of the partition to 
increments of 8MB makes sense.  The partition type **must** be set to 
'2e'.  The typical location for the RomWBW partition is at 1MB with a 
size of 512MB (64 slices).  Below is an example of creating a RomWBW 
partition following these guidelines.

```
FDISK80 for RomWBW, UNA, Mini-M68k, KISS-68030, SBC-188  ----

 4             00       *** empty ***
>>w
Do you really want to write to disk? [N/y]: y
Okay
FDISK exit.
```

At this point, it is best to restart your system to make sure that
the operating system is aware of the partition table updates.  Start
CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from ROM again.

You are now ready to initialize the individual slices of your hard disk 
media.  On RomWBW, slice initialization is done using the CLRDIR 
application.  Since the CLRDIR application works on OS drive letters, 
you must pay attention to how the OS drive letters are mapped to your 
disk devices which is listed when the OS starts.  Let's assume that C: 
has been assigned to slice 0 of the disk you are initializing.  You 
would use `CLRDIR C:` to initialize C: and prepare it hold files. Note 
that CLRDIR will prompt you for confirmation and you must respond with a
**capital** 'Y' to confirm.

After CLRDIR completes, the slice should be ready to use by the operating
system via the drive letter assigned.  Start by using the `DIR` command
on the drive (`DIR C:`).  This should return without error, but list
no files.  Next, use the `STAT` command to confirm that the disk is
using the layout you intended.  For example, use `STAT C:DSK:` and
look at the number of "32  Byte Directory Entries".  It should say
512 for a legacy (hd512) disk layout and 1024 for a modern (hd1024)
disk layout.

Assuming you want to use additional slices, you should initialize them
using the same process.  You may need to reassign OS drive letters to
access some slices that are beyond the ones automatically assigned.
You can use the `ASSIGN` command to handle this.

Once you have your slice(s) initialized, you can begin transferring 
files to the associated drive letters.  Refer to the [Transferring 
Files] section for options to do this.  If you want to make a slice
bootable, you will need to use `SYSCOPY` to setup the system track(s)
of the slice.  The use of `SYSCOPY` depends on the operating system
and is described in the [Operating Systems] section of this document.

As an example, let's assume you want to setup C: as a bootable
Z-System disk and add to it all the files from the ROM disk.  To
setup the system track you would use:

```
B>SYSCOPY C:=B:ZSYS.SYS

SYSCOPY v2.0 for RomWBW CP/M, 17-Feb-2020 (CP/M 2 Mode)
Copyright 2020, Wayne Warthen, GNU GPL v3

Transfer system image from B:ZSYS.SYS to C: (Y/N)? Y
Reading image... Writing image... Done
```

Then, to copy all of the files from the ROM disk to C:, you could use
the `COPY` command as shown below.  In this example, the list of files
being copied has been truncated.

```
B>copy *.* m:
COPY  Version 1.73 (for ZSDOS)   2 Jul 2001
Copying B0:????????.??? to M0:
 -> ASM     .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok
 -> ASSIGN  .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok
 -> CLRDIR  .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok
 -> COMPARE .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok
 -> COPY    .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok
 -> CPM     .SYS..Ok  Verify..Ok
 0 Errors
```

Once this process succeeds, you will be able to boot directly to the
disk slice from the boot loader prompt. See the instructions in
[Starting Operating Systems from Disk] for details on this.

# Operating Systems

One of the primary goals of RomWBW is to expose a set of generic
hardware functions that make it easy to adapt operating systems to
any hardware supported by RomWBW. As a result, there are now 8
operating systems that have been adapted to run under RomWBW. The
adaptations are identical for all hardware supported by RomWBW
because RomWBW hides all hardware specifics from the operating system.

By design, the operating systems provided with RomWBW are original and 
unmodified from their original distribution.  Patches published by the 
authors are generally included or applied.  The various enhancements 
RomWBW provides (such as hard disk slices) are implemented entirely 
within the system adaptation component of each operating system (e.g.,
CP/M CBIOS).  As a result, each operating system should function
exactly as documented by the authors and retain maximum compatibility
with original applications.

Note that all of the operating systems included with RomWBW support the 
same basic filesystem format from DRI CP/M 2.2 (except for p-System). As
a result, a formatted filesystem will be accessible to any operating 
system. The only possible issue is that if you turn on date/time 
stamping using the newer OSes, the older OSes will not understand this. 
Files will not be corrupted, but the date/time stamps will not be 
maintained.

The following sections briefly describe the operating system options
currently available and brief operating notes.

## Digital Research CP/M 2.2

This is the most widely used variant of the Digital Research
operating systems. It has the most basic feature set, but is
essentially the compatibility metric for all other CP/M-like
operating systems including those listed below.

If you are new to the CP/M world, I would recommend using this CP/M 
variant to start with simply because it is the most stable and you are 
less likely to encounter compatibility issues.

#### Documentation

* [CPM Manual]($doc_root$/CPM Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To make a bootable CP/M disk, use the RomWBW `SYSCOPY` tool
to place a copy of the operating system on the boot track of
the disk.  The RomWBW ROM disk has a copy of the boot track
call "CPM.SYS".  For example:

`SYSCOPY C:=B:CPM.SYS`

#### Notes

* You can change media, but it must be done while at the OS
  command prompt and you **must** warm start CP/M by pressing
  ctrl-C.  This is a CP/M 2.2 constraint and is well documented
  in the DRI manual.

* `SUBMIT.COM` has been patched per DRI to always place submit
  files on A:.  This ensures the submitted file will always be
  properly executed.

* The original versions of DDT, DDTZ, and ZSID used the RST 38
  vector which conflicts with interrupt mode 1 use of this vector.
  The DDT, DDTZ, and ZSID applications in RomWBW have been modified
  to use RST 30 to avoid this issue.

* Z-System applications will not run under CP/M 2.2.  For example,
  the `LDDS` date stamper will not work.

## Z-System

Z-System is the most popular non-DRI CP/M workalike "clone" which is generally
referred to as Z-System. Z-System is intended to be an enhanced
version of CP/M and should run all CP/M 2.2 applications. It is
optimized for the Z80 CPU (as opposed to 8080 for CP/M) and has some
significant improvements such as date/time stamping of files.

Z-System is a somewhat ambiguous term because there are multiple 
generations of this software.  RomWBW Z-System is a combination of both 
ZCPR-DJ (the CCP) and ZSDOS 1.1 (the BDOS) when referring to Z-System.  
The latest version of Z-System (ZCPR 3.4) is also provided with RomWBW 
via the NZ-COM adaptation (see below).

#### Documentation

* [ZCPR Manual]($doc_root$/ZCPR Manual.pdf)
* [ZCPR-DJ]($doc_root$/ZCPR-DJ.doc)
* [ZSDOS Manual]($doc_root$/ZSDOS Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To make a bootable Z-System disk, use the RomWBW `SYSCOPY` tool
to place a copy of the operating system on the boot track of
the disk.  The RomWBW ROM disk has a copy of the boot track
call "ZSYS.SYS".  For example:

`SYSCOPY C:=B:ZSYS.SYS`

#### Notes

* Although most CP/M 2.2 applications will run under Z-System, some
  may not work as expected.  The best example is PIP which is not aware
  of the ZSDOS paths and will fail in some scenarios (use `COPY` instead).

* Although ZSDOS can recognize a media change in some cases, it will not
  always work.  You should only change media at a command prompt and be
  sure to warm start the OS with a ctrl-C.

* ZSDOS has a concept of fast relog of drives. This means that after a 
  warm start, it avoids the overhead of relogging all the disk drives. 
  There are times when this causes issues. After using tools like CLRDIR 
  or MAP, you may need to run “RELOG” to get the drive properly 
  recognized by ZSDOS.

* RomWBW fully supports both DateStamper and P2DOS file date/time
  stamping.  You must load the desired stamping module (`LDDS` for
  DateStamper or `LDP2D` for P2DOS).  This could be automated using
  a `PROFILE.SUB` file.  Follow the ZSDOS documentation to initialize
  a disk for stamping.

* ZSVSTAMP expects to be running under the ZCPR 3.X command processor. 
  By default, RomWBW uses ZCPR 1.0 (intentionally, to reduce space usage) 
  and ZSVSTAMP will just abort in this case. It will work fine if you 
  implement NZCOM. ZSVSTAMP is included solely to facilitate usage 
  if/when you install NZCOM.

* FILEDATE only works with DateStamper style date stamping. If you run 
  it on a drive that is not initialized for DateStamper, it will complain 
  `FILEDATE, !!!TIME&.DAT missing`. This is normal and just means that 
  you have not initialized that drive for DateStamper (using PUTDS).

* ZXD will handle either DateStamper or P2DOS type date stamping. 
  However, it **must** be configured appropriately. As distributed, it will 
  look for P2DOS date stamps. Use ZCNFG to reconfigure it for P2DOS if 
  that is what you are using.

* Many of the tools can be configured (using either ZCNFG or DSCONFIG). 
  The configuration process modifies the actual application file itself. 
  This will fail if you try to modify one that is on the ROM disk because 
  it will not be able to update the image.

* DATSWEEP can be configured using DSCONFIG. However, DSCONFIG itself 
  needs to be configured first for proper terminal emulation by using 
  SETTERM. So, run SETTERM on DSCONFIG before using DSCONFIG to configure 
  DATSWEEP!

* After using PUTDS to initialize a directory for ZDS date stamping, I 
  am finding that it is necessary to run RELOG before the stamping 
  routines will actually start working.

* Generic CP/M PIP and ZSDOS path searching do not mix well if you use 
  PIP to copy to or from a directory in the ZSDOS search path. Best to 
  use COPY from the ZSDOS distribution.

## NZCOM Automatic Z-System

NZCOM is a much further refined version of Z-System (ZCPR 3.4). NZCOM
was sold as an enhancement for existing users of CP/M 2.2 or ZSDOS.
For this reason, (by design) NZCOM does not provide a way to boot
directly from disk. Rather, it is loaded after the system boots into
a host OS. On the RomWBW NZCOM disk images, the boot OS is ZSDOS 1.1.
A `PROFILE.SUB` file is included which automatically launches NZCOM
as soon as ZSDOS loads.

NZCOM is highly configurable.  The RomWBW distribution has been
configured in the most basic way possible.  You should refer to the
documentation and use `MKZCM` as desired to customize your system.

NZCOM has substantially more functionality than CP/M or basic
Z-System.  It is important to read the "NZCOM Users
Manual.pdf" document in order to use this operating system effectively.

#### Documentation

* [NZCOM Users Manual]($doc_root$/NZCOM Users Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

Since NZ-COM boots via Z-System, you can make a bootable
NZ-COM disk using `ZSYS.SYS` as described in [Z-System] above.  You
will need to add a `PROFILE.SUB` file to auto-start NZ-COM itself.

#### Notes

* All of the notes for [Z-System] above generally apply to NZCOM.

* There is no `DIR` command, you must use `SDZ` instead.  If you don't
  like this, look into the `ALIAS` facility.

## Digital Research CP/M 3

This is the Digital Research follow-up product to their very popular 
CP/M 2.2 operating system. While highly compatible with CP/M 2.2, it 
features many enhancements and is not 100% compatible. It makes direct 
use of banked memory to increase the user program space (TPA). It also 
has a new suite of support tools and help system.

* [CPM3 System Guide]($doc_root$/CPM3 System Guide.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To create (or update) a CP/M 3 boot drive, you must place `CPMLDR.SYS` on
the system track of the disk.  You must also place `CPM3.SYS` and 
`CCP.COM` on the target drive as regular files.  Do **not** place 
CPM3.SYS on the boot track.  `CPMLDR.SYS` chain loads `CPM3.SYS` which 
must exist as a regular file on the disk.  Subsequently, `CPM3.SYS` 
loads `CCP.COM`.

The CP/M 3 boot files are not included on the ROM disk due to
space constraints.  You will need to transfer the following files to
your system from the RomWBW distribution directory Binary/CPM3.  You
can use XModem for this (or any of the mechanisms in [Transferring
Files].

- `CPMLDR.SYS`
- `CPM3.SYS` or `CPM3BNK.SYS`
- `CCP.COM`

The `CPM3.SYS` boot file is provided in 2 versions.  In the Binary/CPM3 
distribution directory, `CPM3.SYS` is the "non-banked" version of
CP/M 3.  The `CPM3BNK.SYS` file is the "banked" version of CP/M 3.  You 
almost certainly want to transfer the banked `CPM3BNK.SYS` version.

After transferring the boot files to your RomWBW system, you will
need to use `SYSCOPY` to place `CPMLDR.SYS` on the boot track of the
target drive.  `CPM3.SYS` and `CCP.COM` can be copied to the target
drive using any standard file copy tool such as `PIP` or `COPY`.

You do not need to be booted into CP/M 3 to create or update a CP/M 3 
disk.  The recommended approach is to boot CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from 
ROM.  Transfer the boot files to the RAM disk.  Then simply copy the 
files onto the CP/M 3 disk.  Assuming the target CP/M 3 disk is F:, you 
can use the following commands to place the files on the target drive:

```
SYSCOPY F:=A:CPMLDR.SYS
COPY A:CPM3BNK.SYS F:CPM3.SYS
COPY A:CCP.COM F:
```

Note in the example above that `CPM3BNK.SYS` is renamed to `CPM3.SYS`
in the copy command.

#### Notes

- The `COPYSYS` command described in the DRI CP/M 3 documentation is
  not provided with RomWBW.  The RomWBW `SYSCOPY` command is used
  instead.

- Although CP/M 3 is generally able to run CP/M 2.2 programs, this is
  not universally true.  This is especially true of the utility programs
  included with the operating system.  For example, the `SUBMIT`
  program   of CP/M 3 is completely different/incompatible from the
  `SUBMIT` program of CP/M 2.2.

- RomWBW fully supports CP/M 3 file date/time stamping, but this 
  requires that the disk be properly initialized for it.  This process 
  has not been performed on the CP/M 3 disk image.  Follow the 
  CP/M 3 documentation to complete this process, if desired.

## ZPM3

Simeon Cran's ZPM3 is an interesting combination of the features of both
CP/M 3 and ZCPR3. Essentially, it has the features of and 
compatibility with both.

Due to this dual compatibility, the ZPM3 distribution image contains 
most of the standard CP/M 3 files as well as a variety of common ZCPR3 
applications.  However, you will notice that user area 0 of the disk has
only a few files.  Most of the files are distributed among other user 
areas which is standard practice for ZCPR3.  Most importantly, you will 
see most of the applications in user area 15.  The applications can be 
executed from any user area because ZPM3 has a default search path that 
includes User 15.

The ZPM3 distribution comes with essentially no utility programs at
all.  In addition to the standard CP/M 3 utilities, RomWBW includes
a variety of common ZCPR3 utilities.

#### Documentation

ZPM3 has no real documentation.  You are expected to understand both
CP/M 3 and ZCPR 3.

#### Boot Disk

To create (or update) a ZPM3 boot drive, you must place `ZPMLDR.SYS` on 
the system track of the disk.  You must also place `CPM3.SYS`, 
`ZCCP.COM`, `ZINSTAL.ZPM`, and `STARTZPM.COM` on the target drive as 
regular files.  Do **not** place CPM3.SYS on the boot track.  
`ZPMLDR.SYS` chain loads `CPM3.SYS` which must exist as a regular file 
on the disk.  Subsequently, `CPM3.SYS` loads `CCP.COM`.

The CP/M 3 boot files are not included on the ROM disk due to space 
constraints.  You will need to transfer the following files to your 
system from the RomWBW distribution directory Binary/ZPM3.  You can use 
XModem for this (or any of the mechanisms in [Transferring Files].

- `ZPMLDR.SYS`
- `CPM3.SYS`
- `ZCCP.COM`
- `ZINSTAL.ZPM`
- `STARTZPM.COM`

You may be surprised to see the file called `CPM3.SYS`.  This is not a 
typo. Although it is called `CPM3.SYS`, it is ZPM and not the same as 
`CPM3.SYS` in the CPM3 directory.  Also, unlike CP/M 3, ZPM3 is always 
banked, so you will not find two versions of the file.  `CPM3.SYS` is a 
banked implementation of ZPM3.

After transferring the boot files to your RomWBW system, you will
need to use `SYSCOPY` to place `ZPMLDR.SYS` on the boot track of the
target drive.  The remaining boot files can be copied to the target
drive using any standard file copy tool such as `PIP` or `COPY`.

You do not need to be booted into ZPM3 to create or update a ZPM3 
disk.  The recommended approach is to boot CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from 
ROM.  Transfer the boot files to the RAM disk.  Then simply copy the 
files onto the ZPM disk.  Assuming the target ZPM3 disk is F:, you 
can use the following commands to place the files on the target drive:

```
SYSCOPY F:=A:ZPMLDR.SYS
COPY A:CPM3.SYS F:CPM3.SYS
COPY A:CCP.COM F:
COPY A:ZINSTAL.ZPM F:
COPY A:STARTZPM.COM F:
```

#### Notes

- The ZPM3 operating system is contained in the file called CPM3.SYS 
  which is confusing, but this is as intended by the ZPM3 distribution.
  I believe it was done this way to make it easier for users to
  transition from CP/M 3 to ZPM3.

## QP/M

QP/M is another OS providing compatibility with and enhancements
to CP/M 2.2.  It is provided as a bootable disk image for RomWBW.

Refer to the ReadMe.txt file in Source/Images/d_qpm for more details
regarding the RomWBW adaptation and customizations.

#### Documentation

* [QP/M 2.7 Installation Guide and Supplements]($doc_root$/qpm27.pdf)
* [QP/M 2.7 Interface Guide]($doc_root$/qdos27.pdf)
* [QP/M 2.7 Features and Facilities]($doc_root$/qcp27.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

There is no RomWBW-specific boot disk creation procedure.  QP/M
comes with a QINSTALL which is used to install QPM over an existing
CP/M 2 installation or to update an existing QPM disk.  `QINSTALL.COM`
is included with the RomWBW distribution.

#### Notes

- QPM is not available as source.  This implementation was based
  on the QPM binary distribution and has been minimally customized
  for RomWBW.

- QINSTALL is used to customize QPM.  It is included on the
  disk image.  You should review the notes in the ReadMe.txt
  file in Source/Images/d_qpm before making changes.

- In addition to the QPM disk image, all of the QPM distribution
  files can be found in the RomWBW distribution in the
  Source/Images/d_qpm/u0 directory.

- The QPM disk image is not included as one of the slices on the
  RomWBW combo disk image.  If you want to include QPM, you can do
  so by following the directions in Source/Images/Readme.txt.

## UCSD p-System

This is a full implementation of the UCSD p-System IV.0 for Z80
running under RomWBW.  Unlike the OSes above, p-System uses its
own unique filesystem and is not interoperable with other OSes.

It was derived from the p-System Adaptable Z80 System.  Unlike
some other distributions, this implements a native p-System
Z80 Extended BIOS, it does not rely on a CP/M BIOS layer.

The p-System is provided on a hard disk image file called
psys.img.  This must be copied to its own dedicated hard
disk media (CF Card, SD Card, etc.).  It is booted by
selecting slice 0 of the corresponding hard disk unit at
the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  Do not attempt to use
CP/M slices on the same disk.

Refer to the ReadMe.txt file in Source/pSys for more details.

* [UCSD p-System Users Manual]($doc_root$/UCSD p-System Users Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

There is no mechanism provided to create a p-System boot disk from
scratch under RomWBW.  This has already been done as part of the
porting process.  You must use the provided p-System hard disk image
file which is bootable.

#### Notes

* There is no floppy support at this time.

* The hard disk image contains 6 p-System slices which are
  assigned to p-System unit numbers 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12 which
  is standard for p-System.  Slices 0-5 are assigned
  sequentially to these p-System unit numbers and it is
  not possible to reassign them.  Unit #4 (slice 0) is
  bootable and contains all of the p-System distribution
  files.  Unit #5 (slice 1) is just a blank p-System filesystem.
  The other units (9-12) have not been initialized, but this
  can be done from Filer using the Zero command.

* p-System relies heavily on the use of a full screen
  terminal.  This implementation has been setup to expect
  an ANSI or DEC VT-100 terminal or emulator.  The screen
  output will be garbled if no such terminal or emulator
  is used for console output.

* There is no straightforward mechanism to move files in
  and out of p-System.  However, the .vol files in Source/pSys
  can be read and modified by CiderPress.  CiderPress is able
  to add and remove individual files.

## FreeRTOS

Phillip Stevens has ported FreeRTOS to run under RomWBW. FreeRTOS is
not provided in the RomWBW distribution. FreeRTOS is available under
the
[MIT licence](https://www.freertos.org/a00114.html) and further general
information is available at
[FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html).

You can also contact Phillip for detailed information on the Z180
implementation of FreeRTOS for RomWBW.

# Custom Applications

The operation of the RomWBW hosted operating systems is enhanced through
several custom applications. You have already read about one of these --
the `ASSIGN` command.  These applications are functional on all of the
OS variants included with RomWBW.

The applications discussed here are **not** the same as the built-in
ROM applications mentioned previously.  These applications run as
commands within the operating systems provided by RomWBW.  So, these
commands are only available at an operating system prompt after an
operating system has been loaded.

All of the RomWBW Custom Applications are built to function under all
of the RomWBW Operating Systems (except for p-System).  In general,
the applications will automatically adapt as needed to the currently
running operating system.  One exception is `FDU` -- the Floppy Disk
Utility.  This application requires that you pick the floppy disk
interface you want to interact with.

There is more complete documentation of all of these applications in
the related RomWBW manual "$doc_apps$" found in the Doc
directory of the distribution.

The following custom applications are found on the ROM disk and are,
therefore, globally available.

disk image files or the individual files can be found in the Binary/Apps
directory of the distribution.

# FAT Filesystem

The FAT filesystem format that originated with MS-DOS has been almost
ubiquitous across modern computers.  Virtually all operating systems
now support reading and writing files to a FAT filesystem.  For this
reason, RomWBW now has the ability to read and write files on FAT
filesystems.

This is accomplished by running a RomWBW custom application called `FAT`.
This application understands both FAT filesystems as well as CP/M filesystems.

* Files can be copied between a FAT filesystem and a CP/M filesystem,
  but you cannot execute files directly from a FAT filesystem.
* FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 formats are supported.
* Long filenames are not supported.  Files with long filenames will
  show up with their names truncated into the older 8.3 convention.
* A FAT filesystem can be located on floppy or hard disk media.  For
  hard disk media, the FAT filesystem must be located within a valid
  FAT partition.
  
## FAT Filesystem Preparation

In general, you can create media formatted with a FAT filesystem on
your RomWBW computer or on your modern computer.  We will only be
discussing the RomWBW-based approach here.

In the case of a floppy disk, you can use the `FAT` application to
format the floppy disk.  For example, if your floppy disk is on RomWBW
disk unit 2, you could use `FAT FORMAT 2:`.  This will overwrite the
floppy with a FAT filesystem and all previous contents will be lost.
Once formatted this way, the floppy disk can be used in a floppy drive
attached to a modern computer or it can be used on RomWBW using the
other `FAT` tool commands.

In the case of hard disk media, it is necessary to have a FAT
partition.  If you prepared your RomWBW hard disk media using the
disk image process, then this partition will already be present and
you do not need to recreate it.  This default FAT partition is located
at approximately 512MB from the start of your disk and it is 384MB in
size.  So, your hard disk media must be 1GB or greater to use this
default FAT partition.

You can confirm the existence of the FAT partition with `FDISK80` by 
using the 'P' command to show the current partition table.  Here is an 
example of a partition table listing from `FDISK80` that includes the 
FAT partition (labelled "FAT16"):

```
Capacity of disk 4:  (  4G)  7813120      Geom 77381010
Nr  ---Type- A --      Start         End   LBA start  LBA count  Size
 1    RomWBW   2e      8:0:1  1023:15:16        2048    1048576  512M
 2     FAT16   06   1023:0:1  1023:15:16     1050624     786432  384M
 3             00       *** empty ***
 4             00       *** empty ***
```

If your hard disk media does not have a FAT partition already defined,
you will need to define one using FDISK80 by using the 'N' command.
Ensure that the location and size of the FAT partition does not
overlap any of the CP/M slice area and that it fits within the size
of your media.

Once the partition is defined, you will still need to format it.  Just
as with a floppy disk, you use the `FAT` tool to do this.  If your
hard disk media is on RomWBW disk unit 4, you would use `FAT FORMAT 4:`.
This will look something like this:

```
E>fat format 4:

About to format FAT Filesystem on Disk Unit #4.
All existing FAT partition data will be destroyed!!!

Continue (y/n)?

Formatting... Done
```

Your FAT filesystem is now ready to use.

If your RomWBW system has multiple disk drives/slots, you can also just 
create a disk with your modern computer that is a dedicated FAT 
filesystem disk.  You can use your modern computer to format the disk 
(floppy, CF Card, SD Card, etc.), then insert the disk in your RomWBW 
computer and access if using `FAT` based on its RomWBW unit number.

## FAT Application Usage

Complete instructions for the `FAT` application are found in $doc_apps$.
Here, we will just provide a couple of simple examples.  Note that the 
FAT application is not on the ROM disk because it is too large to 
include there.

The most important thing to understand about the `FAT` application is
how it refers to FAT filesystems vs. CP/M filesystems.  It infers this
based on the file specification provided.  If you use a specification
like `C:SAMPLE.TXT`, it will use the C: drive of your CP/M operating
system.  If you use a specification like `4:SAMPLE.TXT`, it will use
the FAT filesystem on the disk in RomWBW disk unit 4.  Basically, if
you start your file or directory specification with a number followed
by a colon, it means FAT filesystem.  Anything else will mean CP/M
filesystem.

Here are a few examples.  This first example shows how to get a FAT
directory listing from RomWBW disk unit 4:

```
E>fat dir 4:

Directory of 4:


E>
```

As you can see, there are currently no files there.  Now let's copy
a file from CP/M to the FAT directory:

```
E>fat copy sample.txt 4:

Copying...

SAMPLE.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE.TXT ... [OK]

    1 File(s) Copied
```

If we list the FAT directory again, you will see the file:

```
E>fat dir 4:

Directory of 4:

01/30/2023  17:50:14         29952  ---A  SAMPLE.TXT

```

Now let's copy the file from the FAT filesystem back to CP/M.  This
time we will get a warning about overwriting the file.  For this
example, we don't want to do that, so we abort and reissue the
command specifying a new filename to use:

```
E>fat copy 4:sample.txt e:

Copying...

4:/SAMPLE.TXT ==> E:SAMPLE.TXT Overwrite? (Y/N) [Skipped]

    0 File(s) Copied

E>fat copy 4:sample.txt e:sample2.txt

Copying...

4:/SAMPLE.TXT ==> E:SAMPLE2.TXT ... [OK]

    1 File(s) Copied
```

Finally, let's try using wildcards:

```
E>fat copy sample*.* 4:

Copying...

SAMPLE.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE.TXT Overwrite? (Y/N) ... [OK]
SAMPLE2.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE2.TXT ... [OK]

    2 File(s) Copied
```

# CP/NET Networking

Digital Research created a simple network file sharing system called 
CP/NET.  This allowed a network server running CP/NOS to host files 
available to network attached CP/M computers.  Essentially, the host
becomes a simple file sharing server.

RomWBW disk images include an adaptation of the DRI CP/NET client 
software provided by Douglas Miller.  RomWBW does not support operation 
as a network server itself.  However, Douglas has also developed a 
Java-based implementation of the DRI network server that can be used to 
provide host services from a modern computer.

Both CP/NET 1.2 and 3.0 clients are provided.  Version 1.2 is for use 
with CP/M 2.2 and compatible OSes.  Version 3.0 is for use with CP/M 3 
and compatible OSes.

The CP/NET client software provided with RomWBW is specifically for the 
MT011 Module developed by Mark T for the RCBus.  The client software 
interacts directly with this hardware.  In a future version of RomWBW, I
hope to add a generic networking API that will allow a greater range of
network hardware to be used.

To use CP/NET effectively, you will want to review the documentation 
provided by Douglas on his
[cpnet-z80 GitHub Project](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80). 
Additionally, you should consult the DRI documentation which is not 
included with RomWBW, but is available on the
[cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site.

Below, I will provide the general steps involved in setting up a
network using MT011 with RomWBW.  The examples are all based on
Z-System.

## CP/NET Client Setup

The CP/NET client files are included on the RomWBW disk images, but
they are found in user area 4.  They are placed there to avoid
confusing anyone that is not specifically trying to run a network
client.

First, you need to merge the files from user area 4 into user area 0.
After booting into Z-System (disk boot), you can copy the files
using the following command:

`COPY 4:*.* 0:`

You will be asked if you want to overwrite `README.TXT`.  It doesn't
really matter, but I suggest you do not overwrite it.

The MT011 Module uses a WizNet network module.  At this point, you will 
need to configure it for your local network.  The definitive guide to 
the use of `WIZCFG` is on the
[cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site in the 
document called "CPNET-WIZ850io.pdf". Here is an example of the commands
needed to configure the WizNet:

|                                    |                                        |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `wizcfg w n F0`                    | set CP/NET node id                     |
| `wizcfg w i 192.168.1.201`         | set WizNet IP address                  |
| `wizcfg w g 192.168.1.1`           | set local network gateway IP address   |
| `wizcfg w s 255.255.255.0`         | set WizNet subnet mask                 |
| `wizcfg w 0 00 192.168.1.3 31100`  | set server node ID, IP address, & port |

You will need to use values appropriate for your local network.  You can
use the command `wiznet w` to display the current values which is 
useful to confirm they have been set as intended.

```
A>wizcfg w
Node ID:  F0H
IP Addr:  192.168.1.201
Gateway:  192.168.1.1
Subnet:   255.255.255.0
MAC:      98:76:B6:11:00:C4
Socket 0: 00H 192.168.1.3 31100 0
```

You will need to reapply these commands every time you power cycle
your RomWBW computer, so I recommend putting them into a `SUBMIT` file.

After applying these commands, you should be able ping the WizNet from
another computer on the local network.  If this works, then the 
client-side is ready.

## CP/NET Sever Setup

These instructions will assume you are using Douglas' CpnetSocketServer
as the server on your network.  The definitive guide to this software
is also on the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80)
site and is called "CpnetSocketServer.pdf".

The software is a Java application, so it can generally run anywhere
there is a Java runtime environment available.  I have normally used
it on a Linux system and have had good results with that.

You will need to download the application called "CpnetSocketServer.jar"
from the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site. The
application uses a configuration file.  My configuration file is called
"cpnet00.rc" and has these contents:

```
cpnetserver_host = 192.168.1.3
cpnetserver_port = 31100
cpnetserver_temp = P
cpnetserver_sid = 00
cpnetserver_max = 16
cpnetserver_root_dir = /home/wayne/cpnet/root
```

You will also need to setup a directory structure with the drive
letters per the documentation.

To start the server, you would use a command like this:

`java -jar CpnetSocketServer.jar conf=cpnet00.rc`

At this point, the server should start and you should see the following:

```
CpnetSocketServer v1.3
Using config in cpnet00.rc
Server 00 Listening on 192.168.1.3 port 31100 debug false
```

Your CP/NET server should now be ready to accept client connections.

## CP/NET Usage

With both the client and server configured, you are ready to load and
use CP/NET on your RomWBW system.  CP/NET documentation is available
on the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site.
The document is called "dri-cpnet.pdf".

After booting your computer, you will always need to start CP/NET using 
the `CPNETLDR` command.  If that works, you can map network drives as 
local drives using the `NETWORK` command.  The `CPNETSTS` command is 
useful for displaying the current status.  Here is a sample session:

```
A>cpnetldr

  Drive D: = LOCAL
  Drive E: = LOCAL
  Drive F: = LOCAL

  Drive H: = LOCAL
  Drive I: = LOCAL
  Drive J: = LOCAL
  Drive K: = Drive C: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive L: = LOCAL
  Drive M: = LOCAL
  Drive N: = LOCAL
  Drive O: = LOCAL
  Drive P: = LOCAL
Console Device = LOCAL
List Device = LOCAL
```

You will see some additional messages on your server when clients
connect.  Here are the messages issued by the server in the above
example:

```
Connection from 192.168.1.201 (31100)
Remote 192.168.1.201 is f0
Creating HostFileBdos 00 device with root dir /home/wayne/cpnet/root
```

At this point CP/NET is ready for general use.

## Network Boot

It is possible to boot your MT011 equipped RomWBW system directly
from a network server.  This means that the operating system will be
loaded directly from the network server and all of your drive letters
will be provided by the network server.

It is important to understand that the operating system that is loaded
in this case is **not** a RomWBW enhanced operating system.  Some
commands (such as the `ASSIGN` command) will not be possible.  Also,
you will only have access to drives provided by the network server --
no local disk drives will be available.

In order to do this, your MT011 Module must be enhanced with an NVRAM 
SPI FRAM mini-board.  The NVRAM is used to store your WizNet 
configuration values so they do not need to be re-entered every time you
cold boot your system.

Using the same values from the previous example, you would
issue the WizNet commands:

```
wizcfg n F0
wizcfg i 192.168.1.201
wizcfg g 192.168.1.1
wizcfg s 255.255.255.0
wizcfg 0 00 192.168.1.3 31100
```

Note that the 'w' parameter is now omitted which causes these values to
be written to NVRAM.

As before, your network server will need to be running 
CpnetSocketServer. However, you will need to setup a directory that 
contains some files that will be sent to your RomWBW system when the 
Network boot is performed.  By default the directory will be
`~/NetBoot`.  In this directory you need to place the following files:

* `cpnos-wbw.sys` found in the Binary directory of RomWBW
* `ndos.spr` found in the Source/Images/cpnet12 directory of RomWBW
* `snios.spr` found in the Source/Images/cpnet12 directory of RomWBW

You also need to make sure CpnetSocketServer is configured with an 'A' 
drive and that drive must contain (at an absolute minimum) the following
file:

* `ccp.spr` found in the Source/Images/cpnet12 directory of RomWBW

Finally, you need to add the following line to your CpnetSocketServer 
configuration file:

`netboot_default = cpnos-wbw.sys`

To perform the network boot, you start your RomWBW system normally which
should leave you at the Boot Loader prompt.  The 'N' command will
initiate the network boot.  Here is an example of what this looks like:

```
RCBus [RCZ180_nat_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]: n

Loading Network Boot...
MT011 WizNET Network Boot

WBWBIOS  SPR  FD00 0100

SNIOS    SPR  F600 0400
NDOS     SPR  EA00 0C00

58K TPA

A>
```

The CP/M operating system and the CP/NET components have been loaded 
directly from the network server.  All of your drive letters are 
automatically mapped directly to the drive letters configured with 
CpnetSocketServer.

List Device = LOCAL
```

At this point you can use CP/M and CP/NET normally, but all disk
access will be to/from the network drives.

# Transferring Files

Transferring files between your modern computer and your RomWBW
system can be achieved in a variety of ways. The most common of these
are described below. All of these have a certain degree of complexity
and I encourage new users to use the available community forums to
seek assistance as needed.

## Serial Port Transfers

RomWBW provides an serial file transfer program called XModem that
has been adapted to run under RomWBW hardware. The program is called
`XM` and is on your ROM disk as well as all of the pre-built disk
images.

You can type `XM` by itself to get usage information. In general, you
will run `XM` with parameters to indicate you want to send or receive
a file on your RomWBW system. Then, you will use your modern
computers terminal program to complete the process.

The `XM` application generally tries to detect the hardware you are
using and adapt to it. However, you must ensure that you have a
reliable serial connection. You must also ensure that the speed of
the connection is not too fast for XModem to service. Alternatively,
you can ensure that hardware flow control is working properly.

There is an odd interaction between XModem and partner terminal
programs that can occur. Essentially, after launching `XM`, you must
start the protocol on your modern computer fairly quickly (usually in
about 20 seconds or so). So, if you do not pick a file on your modern
computer quickly enough, you will find that the transfer completes
about 16K, then hangs. The interaction that causes this is beyond the
scope of this document.

## Disk Image Transfers

It is possible to pass disk images between your RomWBW system and
your modern computer. This assumes you have an appropriate media slot
on your modern computer for the media you want to use (CF Card, SD
Card, or floppy drive).

The general process to get files from your modern computer to a RomWBW
computer is:

1. Use `cpmtools` on your modern computer to create a RomWBW CP/M
filesystem image.

2. Insert your RomWBW media (CF Card, SD Card, or floppy disk) in your
modern computer.

3. Use a disk imaging tool to copy the RomWBW filesystem image onto the
media.

4. Move the media back to the RomWBW computer.

This process is a little complicated, but it has the benefit of
allowing you to get a lot of files over to your RomWBW system quickly
and with little chance of corruption.

The process can be run in reverse to get files from your RomWBW
computer to a modern computer.

The exact use of these tools is a bit too much for this document, but
the tools are all included in the RomWBW distribution along with
usage documents.

Note that the build scripts for RomWBW create the default disk images
supplied with RomWBW. It is relatively easy to customize the contents
of the disk images that are part of RomWBW. This is described in more
detail in the Source/Images directory of the distribution.

## FAT Filesystem Transfers

The ability to interact with FAT filesystems was covered in [FAT 
Filesystem].  This capability means that you can generally use your 
modern computer to make an SD Card or CF Card with a standard FAT32 
filesystem on it, then place that media in your RomWBW computer and 
access the files.

When formatting the media on your modern computer, be sure to pick the 
FAT filesystem. NTFS and other filesystems will not work.  As previously
mentioned, the `FAT` application does not understand long filenames, 
only the traditional 8.3 filenames.  If you have files on your modern 
computer with long filenames, it is usually easiest to rename them on 
the modern computer.

To copy files from your modern computer to your RomWBW computer, start 
by putting the disk media with the FAT filesystem in your modern 
computer.  The modern computer should recognize it. Then copy the files 
you want to get to your RomWBW computer onto this media.  Once done, 
remove the media from your modern computer and insert it in the RomWBW 
computer.  Finally, use the `FAT` tool to copy the files onto a CP/M 
drive.

This process works just fine in reverse if you want to copy files from a
CP/M filesystem to your modern computer.

**WARNING**: If you are using media that contains both a FAT partition 
and a RomWBW partition, your modern computer may be confused by the 
RomWBW partition.  In some cases, it will prompt you to format the 
RomWBW partition because it doesn't know what it is. You will be 
prompted before it does this -- just be careful not to allow it.

# Customizing RomWBW

## Startup Command Processing

Most of the operating systems supported by RomWBW provide a mechanism to
run commands at boot. This is similar to the AUTOEXEC.BAT files from
MS-DOS.

With the exception of ZPM3 and p-System, all operating systems will look
for a file called `PROFILE.SUB` on the system drive at boot. If it is
found, it will be processed as a standard CP/M submit file. You can read
about the use of the SUBMIT facility in the CP/M manuals included in
the RomWBW distribution. Note that the boot disk must also have a copy
of `SUBMIT.EXE`.

Note that the automatic startup processing generally requires booting
to a disk drive. Since the ROM disk is not writable, there is no
simple way to add/edit a `PROFILE.SUB` file there. If you want to
customize your ROM and add a `PROFILE.SUB` file to the ROM Disk, it
will work, but is a lot harder than using a boot disk.

In the case of ZPM3, the file called `STARTZPM.COM` will be run at
boot. To customize this file, you use the ZCPR ALIAS facility. You
will need to refer to ZCPR documentation for more information on the
ALIAS facility.

p-System has its own startup command processing mechanism that is
covered in the p-System documentation.

## ROM Customization

The pre-built ROM images are configured for the basic capabilities of
each platform. Additionally, some of the typical add-on hardware for
each platform will be automatically detected and used. If you want to
go beyond this, RomWBW provides a very flexible configuration
mechanism based on configuration files. Creating a customized ROM
requires running a build script, but it is quite easy to do.

Essentially, the creation of a custom ROM is accomplished by updating
a small configuration file, then running a script to compile the
software and generate the custom ROM and disk images. There are build
scripts for Windows, Linux, and MacOS to accommodate virtually all
users. All required build tools (compilers, assemblers, etc.) are
included in the distribution, so it is not necessary to setup a build
environment on your computer.

RomWBW can be built on modern Windows, Linux, or MacOS computers.  The
process for building a custom ROM is documented in the ReadMe.txt file
in the Source directory of the distribution.

For those who are interested in more than basic system customization,
note that all source code is provided (including the operating
systems). Modification of the source code is considered an expert
level task and is left to the reader to pursue.

Note that the ROM customization process does not apply to UNA. All
UNA customization is performed within the ROM setup script that is
built into the ROM.

# UNA Hardware BIOS

John Coffman has produced a new generation of hardware BIOS called
UNA. The standard RomWBW distribution includes its own hardware
BIOS. However, RomWBW can alternatively be constructed with UNA as
the hardware BIOS portion of the ROM. If you wish to use the UNA
variant of RomWBW, then just program your ROM with the ROM image
called "UNA_std.rom" in the Binary directory. This one image is
suitable on **all** of the platforms and hardware UNA supports.

UNA is customized dynamically using a ROM based setup routine and the
setup is persisted in the system NVRAM of the RTC chip. This means
that the single UNA-based ROM image can be used on most of the
RetroBrew platforms and is easily customized. UNA also supports FAT
file system access that can be used for in-situ ROM programming and
loading system images.

While John is likely to enhance UNA over time, there are currently a
few things that UNA does not support:

* Floppy Drives
* Terminal Emulation
* Zeta 1, N8, RCBus, Easy Z80, and Dyno Systems
* Some older support boards

The UNA version embedded in RomWBW is the latest production release
of UNA. RomWBW will be updated with John's upcoming UNA release with
support for VGA3 as soon as it reaches production status.

Please refer to the
[UNA BIOS Firmware Page](https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org/doku.php?id=software:firmwareos:una:start)
for more information on UNA.

## UNA Usage Notes

- At startup, UNA will display a prompt similar to this:

  `Boot UNA unit number or ROM? [R,X,0..3] (R):`

  You generally want to choose 'R' which will then launch the RomWBW
  loader.  Attempting to boot from a disk using a number at the UNA
  prompt will only work for the legacy (hd512) disk format.  However,
  if you go to the RomWBW loader, you will be able to perform a disk
  boot on either disk format.

- The disk images created and distributed with RomWBW do not have the
  correct system track code for UNA.  In order to boot to disk under
  UNA, you must first use SYSCOPY to update the system track of the
  target disk.  The UNA ROM disk has the correct system track files
  for UNA: `CPM.SYS` and `ZSYS.SYS`.  So, you can boot a ROM OS and
  then use one of these files to update the system track.

- Only Z-System and CP/M 2 are available OSes under UNA at this time.
  Since NZ-COM launches from CP/M 2, it is usable.  p-System is not
  usable under UNA.

- Some of the RomWBW-specific applications are not UNA compatible.

# Upgrading

Upgrading to a newer release of RomWBW is essentially just a matter of
updating the ROM chip in your system. If you have spare ROM chips for
your system and a ROM programmer, it is always safest to retain your
existing, working ROM chip and program a new one with the new
firmware. If the new one fails to boot, you can easily return to the
known working ROM.

Prior to attempting to reprogram your actual ROM chip, you may wish to
"try" the update to ensure it will work on your system. With RomWBW, you
can upload a new ROM image executable and load it from the command
line. For each ROM image file (.rom) in the Binary directory, you will
find a corresponding application file (.com). For example, for
SBC_std.rom, there is also an SBC_std.com file. You can upload the .com
file to your system using XModem, then simply run the .com file. You
will see your system go through the normal startup process just like it
was started from ROM. However, your ROM has not been updated and the
next time you boot your system, it will revert to the system image
contained in ROM.

## Upgrading via Flash Utility

If you do not have easy access to a ROM programmer, it is usually
possible to reprogram your system ROM using the FLASH utility from
Will Sowerbutts. This application, called FLASH.COM, can be found on the
ROM drive of any running system. In this case, you would need to
transfer the new ROM image (.rom) over to your system using XModem (or
one of the other mechanisms described in the Transferring Files
section). The ROM image is too large to fit on your RAM drive,
so you will need to transfer it to a larger storage drive. Once the
ROM image is on your system, you can use the FLASH application to
update your ROM. The following is a typical example of transferring
ROM image using XModem and flashing the chip in-situ.

```
E>xm r rom.rom

XMODEM v12.5 - 07/13/86
RBC, 28-Aug-2019 [WBW], ASCI

Receiving: E0:ROM.IMG
7312k available for uploads
File open - ready to receive
To cancel: Ctrl-X, pause, Ctrl-X

Thanks for the upload

E>flash write rom.rom
FLASH4 by Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com> version 1.2.3

Using RomWBW (v2.6+) bank switching.
Flash memory chip ID is 0xBFB7: 39F040
Flash memory has 128 sectors of 4096 bytes, total 512KB
Write complete: Reprogrammed 2/128 sectors.
Verify (128 sectors) complete: OK!
```

Obviously, there is some risk to this approach since any issues with the
programming or ROM image could result in a non-functional system.

To confirm your ROM chip has been successfully updated, restart your
system and boot an operating system from ROM. Do not boot from a disk
device yet. Review the boot messages to see if any issues have
occurred.

## Upgrading via XModem Flash Updater

Similar to using the Flash utility, the system ROM can be updated
or upgraded through the ROM based updater utility. This works by
by reprogrammed the flash ROM as the file is being transferred.

This has the advantage that secondary storage is not required to
hold the new image.

From the Boot Loader menu select X (Xmodem Flash Updater) and then
U (Begin Update). Then initiate the Xmodem transfer of the .img or
.upd file.

More information can be found in the ROM Applications document.

## Post Upgrade System Image and Application Update Process

Once you are satisfied that the ROM is working well, you will need to
update the system images and RomWBW custom applications on your disk
drives. The system images and custom applications are matched to the
RomWBW ROM firmware in use. If you attempt to boot a disk or run
applications that have not been updated to match the current ROM
firmware, you are likely to have odd problems.

The simplest way to update your disk media is to just use your modern
computer to overwrite the entire media with the latest disk image of
your choice. This process is described below in the [Disk Images]
section. If you wish to update existing disk media in your system, you
need to perform the following steps.

If the disk is bootable, you need to update the system image on the
disk using the procedure described in the [Operating Systems] section
of this document.

Finally, if you have copies of any of the RomWBW custom applications
on your hard disk, you need to update them with the latest copies. The
following applications are found on your ROM disk. Use COPY to copy
them over any older versions of the app on your disk:

* ASSIGN.COM
* SYSCOPY.COM
* MODE.COM
* FDU.COM
* FORMAT.COM
* XM.COM
* FLASH.COM
* FDISK80.COM
* TALK.COM
* RTC.COM
* TIMER.COM

For example: `B>COPY ASSIGN.COM C:`

Some RomWBW custom applications are too large to fit on the ROM disk.
If you are using any of these you will need to transfer them to your
system and then update all copies. These applications are found in
the Binary/Apps directory of the distribution and in all of the disk
images.

* FAT.COM
* TUNE.COM

## System Update

As previously described, a RomWBW ROM contains ROM applications as well 
as a ROM disk image.  If you are upgrading your ROM with a new patch 
level release, you may wish to upgrade just the application portion of 
the ROM.  This is referred to as a System Update.

If the system running ROMWBW utilizes the SST39SF040 Flash chip then it 
is possible to do a System Update in place of a System Upgrade in some 
cases.  A System Update would involve only updating the BIOS, ROM 
applications and ROM-hosted operating systems.

A System Update may be more favorable than a System Upgrade in cases
such as:

 - Overwriting of the ROM drive contents is not desired.
 - Temporary disk space is unavailable to hold a full ROM image.
 - To reduce the time taken to transfer and flash a full ROM.
 - Configuration changes are only minor and do not impact disk
   applications.

The RomWBW build process generates a system update file along with
the normal ROM image and can be identified by the extension ".upd". It
will be 128Kb in size. In comparison the normal ROM image will have
the extension ".rom" and be 512Kb or 1024Kb in size.

Transferring and flashing the System Update is accomplished in the same 
manner as described above in [Upgrading via Flash Utility] with the 
required difference being that the flash application needs to be 
directed to complete a partial flash using the /P command line switch.

# Appendixes

`\clearpage`{=latex}

## Appendix A - Pre-built ROM Images

The standard ROM images will detect and install support for certain
devices and peripherals that are on-board or frequently used with
each platform as documented below.  If the device or peripheral is
not detected at boot, the ROM will simply bypass support
appropriately.

By default, RomWBW will use the first available character device it
discovers for the initial console.  Serial devices are scanned in
the following order:

#. ASCI: Zilog Z180 CPU Built-in Serial Ports
#. Z2U: Zilog Z280 CPU Built-in Serial Ports
#. UART: 16C550 Family Serial Interface
#. DUART: SCC2681 or compatible Dual UART
#. SIO: Zilog Serial Port Interface
#. ACIA: MC68B50 Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter

In some cases, support for multiple hardware components with potentially
conflicting resource usage are handled by a single ROM image.  It is up
to the user to ensure that no conflicting hardware is in use.

The RomWBW `TUNE` application will detect an AY-3-8910/YM2149
Sound Module regardless of whether support for it is included in
the RomWBW HBIOS configuration.

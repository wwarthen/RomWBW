#### Preface

This document is a general usage guide for the RomWBW software and is
generally the best place to start with RomWBW.  There are several
companion documents you should refer to as appropriate:

* $doc_sys$ discusses much of the internal design and construction
  of RomWBW.  It includes a reference for the RomWBW HBIOS API
  functions.

* $doc_apps$ is a reference for the ROM-hosted and OS-hosted applications
  created or customized to enhance the operation of RomWBW.

* $doc_catalog$ is a reference for the contents of the disk images
  provided with RomWBW.  It is somewhat out of date at this time.

* $doc_errata$ is updated as needed to document issues or anomalies
  discovered in the current software distribution.

Since RomWBW is purely a software product for many different platforms,
the documentation does **not** cover hardware construction,
configuration, or troubleshooting -- please see your hardware provider
for this information.

Each of the operating systems and ROM applications included with RomWBW
are sophisticated tools in their own right. It is not reasonable to
fully document their usage here. However, you will find complete manuals
in PDF format in the Doc directory of the distribution.  The intention
of this document is to describe the operation of RomWBW and the ways in
which it enhances the operation of the included applications and
operating systems.

On a personal note, I found this document very difficult to write.
Members of the retro-computing community have dramatically different
experiences, skill levels, and desires.  I realize some readers will
find this document far too basic.  Others will find it lacking in many
areas.  I am doing my best and encourage you to provide constructive
feedback.

#### Conventions

##### Size Suffixes

Within this document and in RomWBW in general, the use of size
suffixes KB, MB, GB, and TB refer to the binary variant as shown
below.  The modern suffixes (KiB, MiB, etc.) are not used here because
they were not prevalent during the time that the RomWBW OSes were
used.  This keeps all of RomWBW and associated applications consistent.

| Suffix     | Value     | Meaning                                |

##### Links and URLs

Many of the references in this document to Internet addresses (URLs)
do not provide the address in the text.  However, these links are
embedded and "clickable" within the documents.  Your PDF viewer should
highlight these links in some manner (typically an alternate color
or an underline).

# Overview

RomWBW software provides a complete, commercial quality 
implementation of CP/M (and workalike) operating systems and 
applications for modern Z80/180/280 retro-computing hardware systems.
A wide variety of platforms are supported including those
produced by these developer communities:

* [RetroBrew Computers](https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org)
  (<https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org>)
* [RC2014](https://rc2014.co.uk) (<https://rc2014.co.uk>), \
  [RC2014-Z80](https://groups.google.com/g/rc2014-z80)
  (<https://groups.google.com/g/rc2014-z80>)
* [Retro Computing](https://groups.google.com/g/retro-comp)
  (<https://groups.google.com/g/retro-comp>)
* [Small Computer Central](https://smallcomputercentral.com/)
  (<https://smallcomputercentral.com/>)

A complete list of the currently supported platforms is found in the
[Installation] section.

General features include:

* Z80 Family CPUs including Z80, Z180, and Z280
* Banked memory services for several banking designs
* Disk drivers for RAM, ROM, Floppy, IDE ATA/ATAPI, CF, SD, USB, Zip, Iomega
* Serial drivers including UART (16550-like), ASCI, ACIA, SIO
* Video drivers including TMS9918, SY6545, MOS8563, HD6445
* Keyboard (PS/2) drivers via VT8242 or PPI interfaces
* Real time clock drivers including DS1302, BQ4845
* OSes: CP/M 2.2, ZSDOS, CP/M 3, NZ-COM, ZPM3, QPM, p-System, and FreeRTOS
* Built-in VT-100 terminal emulation support

RomWBW is distributed as both source code and pre-built ROM and disk
images. Some of the provided software can be launched directly from the
ROM firmware itself:

* System Monitor
* Operating Systems (CP/M 2.2, ZSDOS)
* ROM BASIC (Nascom BASIC and Tasty BASIC)
* ROM Forth

A dynamic disk drive letter assignment mechanism allows mapping 
operating system drive letters to any available disk media. 
Additionally, mass storage devices (IDE Disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.) 
support the use of multiple slices (up to 256 per device). Each slice 
contains a complete CP/M filesystem and can be mapped independently to 
any drive letter. This overcomes the inherent size limitations in legacy
OSes and allows up to 2GB of accessible storage on a single device.

The pre-built ROM firmware images are generally suitable for most
users. However, it is also very easy to modify and build custom ROM
images that fully tailor the firmware to your specific preferences.
All tools required to build custom ROM firmware under Windows are
included -- no need to install assemblers, etc.  The firmware can also
be built using Linux or MacOS after confirming a few standard tools
have been installed.

Multiple disk images are provided in the distribution. Most disk
images contain a complete, bootable, ready-to-run implementation of a
specific operating system. A "combo" disk image contains multiple
slices, each with a full operating system implementation. If you use
this disk image, you can easily pick whichever operating system you
want to boot without changing media.

By design, RomWBW isolates all of the hardware specific functions in
the ROM chip itself.  The ROM provides a hardware abstraction layer
such that all of the operating systems and applications on a disk
will run on any RomWBW-based system.  To put it simply, you can take
a disk (or CF/SD/USB Card) and move it between systems transparently.

A tool is provided that allows you to access a FAT-12/16/32 filesystem. 
The FAT filesystem may be coresident on the same disk media as RomWBW 
slices or on stand-alone media.  This makes exchanging files with modern
OSes such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux very easy.

# Getting Started

## Acquiring RomWBW

The [RomWBW Repository](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW)
(<https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW>) on GitHub is the official 
distribution location for all project source and documentation.  The 
fully-built distribution releases are available on the
[RomWBW Releases Page](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases)
(<https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases>) of the repository.  On 
this page, you will normally see a Development Snapshot as well as 
recent stable releases. Unless you have a specific reason, I suggest you
 stick to the most recent stable release. Expand the "Assets" drop-down 
for the release you want to download, then select the asset named 
RomWBW-vX.X.X-Package.zip. The Package asset includes all pre-built ROM 
and Disk images as well as full source code. The other assets contain 
only source code and do not have the pre-built ROM or disk images.

All source code and distributions are maintained on GitHub. Code
contributions are very welcome.

#### Distribution Directory Layout

The RomWBW distribution is a compressed zip archive file organized in
a set of directories. Each of these directories has its own
ReadMe.txt file describing the contents in detail. In summary, these
directories are:

| **Directory**            | **Description**                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Binary**               | The final output files of the build process are placed here. Most importantly, the ROM images with the file names ending in ".rom" and disk images ending in .img. |
| **Doc**                  | Contains various detailed documentation, both RomWBW specifically as well as the operating systems and applications.                                               |
| **Source**               | Contains the source code files used to build the software and ROM images.                                                                                          |
| **Tools**                | Contains the programs that are used by the build process or that may be useful in setting up your system.                                                          |

## Installation

In general, installation of RomWBW on your platform is very simple. You
just need to program your ROM with the correct ROM image from the RomWBW
distribution.  Subsequently, you can write disk images on your disk
drives (IDE disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.) which then provides even more
functionality.

**NOTE:** The pre-built ROM images distributed with RomWBW are based on
the default system configurations as determined by the hardware
provider/designer.  This document does not provide hardware
construction or configuration information.  Please contact your hardware
provider/designer as needed.

The pre-built ROM images will automatically detect and support typical
devices for their corresponding platform including serial ports, video
adapters, on-board disk interfaces, and PropIO/ParPortProp boards
without building a custom ROM. The distribution is a .zip archive. After
downloading it to a working directory on your modern computer
(Windows/Linux/Mac) use any zip tool to extract the contents of the
archive.

Depending on how you got your hardware, you may have already been
provided with a pre-programmed ROM chip. If so, use that initially.
Otherwise, you will need to use a ROM programmer to initially program
your ROM chip. Please refer to the documentation that came with your ROM
programmer for more information.

The Binary directory of the distribution contains the pre-built ROM and
disk images.  Refer to [Supported Platforms] below to identify the
correct ROM image for your system.

Once you have a running RomWBW system, you can generally update your ROM
to a newer version in-situ with the included ROM Flashing tool (Will 
Sowerbutts' FLASH application) as described in the [Upgrading] chapter
of this document.

## Supported Platforms

The table below summarizes the hardware platforms currently supported
by RomWBW along with the standard pre-built ROM image(s).  RomWBW does
allow for the creation of ROM images with custom configurations.  This
is discussed in [Customizing RomWBW].

RCBus refers to Spencer Owen's RC2014 bus specification and derivatives
including RC26, RC40, RC80, and BP80.

Additional information for each of the system configurations supported
by the ROM images listed above is found in
[Appendix A - Pre-built ROM Images].

The RCBus Z180 & Z280 require a separate RAM/ROM memory module. There 
are two types of these modules and you must pick the correct ROM for 
your type of memory module.  The first option is the same as the 512K 
RAM/ROM module for RC/BP80 Bus.  This is called external ("ext") because
the bank switching is performed externally from the CPU.  The second 
type of RAM/ROM module has no bank switching logic -- this is called 
native ("nat") because the CPU itself provides the bank switching logic.
Only Z180 and Z280 CPUs have the ability to do bank switching in the 
CPU, so the ext/nat selection only applies to them.  Z80 CPUs have no 
built-in bank switching logic, so they are always configured for 
external bank switching.

All pre-built ROM images are pure binary files (they are not "hex"
files).  They are intended to be programmed starting at the very start
of the ROM chip (address 0).  Most of the pre-built images are
512KB in size.  If your system utilizes a larger ROM, you can just
program the image into the first 512KB of the ROM for now.

Initially, don't worry about trying to write a disk image to any disk 
(or CF/SD/USB) devices you have.  This will be covered later.  You will 
be able to boot and check out your system with just the ROM.

Connect a serial terminal or computer with terminal emulation software 
to the primary serial port of your CPU board. You may need to refer to 
your hardware provider's documentation for details. A null-modem 
connection may be required. Set the baud rate as indicated in the table 
above. Set the line characteristics to 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no 
parity, and no flow control. If possible, select ANSI or VT-100 terminal
emulation.  Hardware flow control is not required for terminal
operation, but may be necessary for [Serial Port Transfers].

RomWBW will automatically attempt to detect and support typical add-on
components for each of the systems supported. More information on the
required system configuration and optional supported components for
each ROM is found in [Appendix A - Pre-built ROM Images].

## System Startup

Upon power-up, your terminal should display a sign-on banner within 2
seconds followed by hardware inventory and discovery information. When
hardware initialization is completed, a boot loader prompt allows you to
choose a ROM-based operating system, system monitor, application, or boot
from a disk device.

Here is an example of a fairly typical startup.  Your system will have
different devices and configuration, but the startup should look
similar.

If your system completes the ROM-based boot process successfully, you
should see the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  For example:

```
RCBus [RCZ80_kio] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

If you get to this prompt, your system has completed the boot process
and is ready to accept commands.  Note that the Boot Loader is not
an operating system or application.  It is essentially the point where
you choose which operating system or application you want RomWBW to
execute.

The Boot Loader is explained in detail in the next section.  For now,
you can try a few simple commands to confirm that you can interact
with the system.

At the Boot Loader prompt, you can type `H <enter>` for help.  You
can type `L <enter>` to list the available built-in ROM applications.
If your terminal supports ANSI escape sequences, you can try the
'P' command to play a simple on-screen game.  Instructions for the
game are found in $doc_apps$.

If all of this seems fine, your ROM has been successfully programmed.
See the [Boot Loader Operation] section of this document for further
instructions on use of the Boot Loader.

## Core System Information

During startup, the first few lines of information displayed provide the
most basic information on your system.  In the example above, these
lines are the Core System Information:

```
RomWBW HBIOS v3.1.1-pre.183, 2022-10-04

RCBus [RCZ80_kio] Z80 @ 7.372MHz
0 MEM W/S, 1 I/O W/S, INT MODE 2, Z2 MMU
512KB ROM, 512KB RAM
ROM VERIFY: 00 00 00 00 PASS
```

The first line is a version identification banner for RomWBW.  After
that you see a group of 4 lines describing the basic system.  In this
example, the platform is the RCBus running a configuration named
"RCZ80_kio".  The CPU is a Z80 with a current clock speed of 7.372 MHz.
There are 0 memory wait states and 1 I/O wait state.  Z80 interrupt mode
2 is active and the bank memory manager is type "Z2" which is standard
for RCBus.  The system has 512KB of ROM total and 512KB of RAM total.
Finally, a verification of the checksums of the critical ROM banks is
shown (all 4 should be 00).

RomWBW attempts to detect the running configuration of the
system at startup.  Depending on your hardware, there may be
inaccuracies in this section.  For example, in some cases the CPU clock
speed is assumed rather than actually measured.  This does not generally
affect the operation of your system.  If you want to correct any of the
information displayed, you can create a custom ROM which is described
later.

## Hardware Discovery

The next set of messages during boot show the hardware devices as
they are probed and initially configured.  In the example above, these
lines are:

```
KIO: IO=0x80 ENABLED
CTC: IO=0x84 TIMER MODE=TIM16
AY: MODE=RCZ80 IO=0xD8 NOT PRESENT
SIO0: IO=0x89 SIO MODE=115200,8,N,1
SIO1: IO=0x8B SIO MODE=115200,8,N,1
DSRTC: MODE=STD IO=0xC0 NOT PRESENT
MD: UNITS=2 ROMDISK=384KB RAMDISK=256KB
FD: MODE=RCWDC IO=0x50 NOT PRESENT
IDE: IO=0x10 MODE=RC
IDE0: NO MEDIA
IDE1: NO MEDIA
PPIDE: IO=0x20
PPIDE0: LBA BLOCKS=0x00773800 SIZE=3815MB
PPIDE1: NO MEDIA
```

What you see will depend on your specific system and ROM, but should
match the hardware present in your system.  Each device has a tag that
precedes the colon.  This tag identifies the driver and instance of each
device.  For example, the tag "SIO0:" refers to the SIO serial port
driver and specifically the first channel.  The "SIO1:" tag refers to
the second channel.

In many cases you will see IO=0xNN in the data following the tag.  This
identifies the base I/O port address of the hardware device and is
useful for identifying hardware conflicts.

Note that you may see some lines indicating that the associated
hardware is not present.  Above, you can see that the FD driver
did not find a floppy interface.  Lines such as these are completely
normal when your system does not have the associated hardware.

Finally, be aware that all ROMs are configured to identify specific
hardware devices at specific port addresses.  If you add hardware
to your system that is not automatically identified, you may need
to build a custom ROM to add support for it.  Building a custom ROM
is covered later.

[Appendix B - Device Summary] contains a list of the RomWBW hardware
devices which may help you identify the hardware discovered in your
system.

## Device Unit Assignments

In order to support a wide variety of hardware, RomWBW HBIOS uses a
modular approach to implementing device drivers and presenting devices
to an operating system. In general, all devices are classified as
one of the following:

* Disk (RAM/ROM Disk, Floppy Disk, Hard Disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.)
* Character (Serial Ports, Parallel Ports, etc.)
* Video (Video Display/Keyboard Interfaces)
* Sound (Audio Playback Devices)
* RTC/NVRAM (Real Time Clock, Non-volatile RAM)
* System (Internal Services, e.g. Timer, DMA, etc.)

HBIOS uses the concept of unit numbers to present a generic set of
hardware devices to the operating system. As an example, a typical
system might have a ROM Disk, RAM Disk, Floppy Drives, and Disk
Drives. All of these are considered disk devices and are presented
to the operating system as generic block devices. This means that
each operating system does not need to embed code to interact directly
with all of the different hardware devices -- RomWBW takes care of that.

In the final group of startup messages, a device unit summary table is
displayed so that you can see how the actual hardware devices have
been mapped to unit numbers during startup.

```
Unit        Device      Type              Capacity/Mode
----------  ----------  ----------------  --------------------
Char 0      UART0:      RS-232            38400,8,N,1
Char 1      UART1:      RS-232            38400,8,N,1
Disk 0      MD1:        RAM Disk          384KB,LBA
Disk 1      MD0:        ROM Disk          384KB,LBA
Disk 2      FD0:        Floppy Disk       3.5",DS/HD,CHS
Disk 3      FD1:        Floppy Disk       3.5",DS/HD,CHS
Disk 4      IDE0:       CompactFlash      3815MB,LBA
Disk 5      IDE1:       Hard Disk         --
Disk 6      PRPSD0:     SD Card           1886MB,LBA
Video 0     CVDU0:      CRT               Text,80x25
```

In this example, you can see that the system has a total of 7 Disk
Units numbered 0-6. There are also 2 Character Units and 1 Video
Unit. The table shows the unit numbers assigned to each of the
devices. Notice how the unit numbers are assigned sequentially
regardless of the specific device.

There may or may not be media in the disk devices listed. For example,
the floppy disk devices (Disk Units 2 & 3) may not have a floppy in
the drive. Also note that Disk Unit 4 shows a disk capacity, but
Disk Unit 5 does not. This is because the PPIDE interface of the
system supports up to two drives, but there is only one actual drive
attached. A unit number is assigned to all available devices
regardless of whether they have actual media installed at boot time.

Note that Character Unit 0 is the initial system console unless modified
in a customized ROM image.

If your system has an RTC/NVRAM device, it will not be listed in the
unit summary table. Since only a single RTC/NVRAM device can exist in
one system, unit numbers are not required nor used for this type of
device.  Also, System devices are not listed because they are entirely
internal to RomWBW.

# Boot Loader Operation

Once your system has completed the startup process, it presents a
Boot Loader command prompt.  The purpose of the Boot Loader is to
select and launch a desired application or operating system.  It also
has the ability to configure some aspects of system operation.

After starting your system, following the hardware initialization, you
will see the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  Below is an example.  Note
that the text preceding "Boot Loader" will vary and identifies your
specific system and configuration.

```
Mark IV [MK4_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

From the Boot Loader prompt, you can enter commands to select and launch any of
the RomWBW operating systems or ROM applications.  It also allows you to
manage some basic settings of the system.  To enter a command, just
enter the command followed by ***\<enter\>***.

For example, typing `H<enter>` will display a short command summary:

```
Boot [H=Help]: h

  L           - List ROM Applications
  D           - Disk Device Inventory
  R           - Reboot System
  I <u> [<c>] - Set Console Interface/Baud code
  V [<n>]     - View/Set HBIOS Diagnostic Verbosity
  <u>[.<s>]   - Boot Disk Unit/Slice
```

Likewise the `L` command will display the list of ROM Applications that
you can launch right from the Boot Loader:

```
Boot [H=Help]: L

ROM Applications:

  M: Monitor
  Z: Z-System
  C: CP/M 2.2
  F: Forth
  B: BASIC
  T: Tasty BASIC
  P: Play a Game
  N: Network Boot
  X: XModem Flash Updater
  U: User App
```

## Starting Applications from ROM

To start a ROM application you just enter the corresponding letter at
the Boot Loader prompt.  In the following example, we launch the
built-in Microsoft BASIC interpreter.  From within BASIC, we use the
`BYE` command to return to the Boot Loader:

```
Boot [H=Help]: b

Mark IV [MK4_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

The following ROM applications and OSes are available at the boot loader
prompt:

| **Application**   | **Description**                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monitor           | Z80 system debug monitor w/ Intel Hex loader                   |
| CP/M 2.2          | Digital Research CP/M 2.2 OS                                   |
| Z-System          | ZSDOS 1.1 w/ ZCPR 1 (Enhanced CP/M compatible OS)              |
| Forth             | Brad Rodriguez's ANSI compatible Forth language                |
| BASIC             | Microsoft ROM BASIC                                            |
| Tasty&nbsp;BASIC  | Dimitri Theuling's Tiny BASIC implementation                   |
| Play              | A simple video game (requires ANSI terminal emulation)         |
| Network&nbsp;Boot | Boot system via Wiznet MT011 device                            |
| Flash&nbsp;Update | Upload and flash a new ROMWBW image using xmodem               |
| User App          | User written application placeholder                           |

The User App is provided as a way to access a custom written
ROM module.  In the pre-built ROMs, selecting User App will just
return to the Boot Loader menu.  If you are interested in creating a
custom application to run here, review the "usrrom.asm" file in the
Source/HBIOS folder of the distribution.

Each of the ROM Applications is documented in $doc_apps$.  Some
of the applications (such as BASIC) also have their own independent
manual in the Doc directory of the distribution.  The OSes included
in the ROM (CP/M 2.2 & Z-System) are described in the Operating Systems
chapter of this document.

In general, the command to exit any of these applications and restart
the system is `BYE`. The exceptions are the Monitor which uses `X` and
Play which uses `Q`.

**NOTE:** Of the ROM Applications, only the operating systems (CP/M and 
Z-System) have the ability to interact with disk drives. So, other than 
these 2 OSes, the ROM Applications do **not** have any way to save or 
load data from peristent/disk storage.  For example, if you launch BASIC
from the Boot Loader, you will not be able to save or load your 
programs.  You will need to start an operating system first and then run
BASIC in order to save or load programs.

Two of the ROM Applications are, in fact, complete operating systems.
Specifically, "CP/M 2.2" and "Z-System" are provided so that you can
actually start either operating system directly from your ROM.  This
technique is useful when:

* You don't yet have any real disk drives in your system
* You want to setup real disk drives for the first time
* You are upgrading your system and need to upgrade your real disk drives

The RAM disk and ROM disk drives will be available even if you have
no physical disk devices attached to your system.

Booting an operating system from ROM is not intended as a way to use
your operating system on a long-term basis.  The ROM disk has only
a small subset of the operating system files.  Additionally, you
cannot easily customize your ROM disk because you cannot write to it.
For any significant use of an operating system, you should boot directly
to the disk/slice that contains the complete operating system.  This
is described in the next section.

## Starting Operating Systems from Disk

In order to make use of the more sophisticated operating systems
available with RomWBW, you will need to boot an operating system
from a disk.  Setting up disks is described in detail later.  For now,
we will just go over the command line for performing this type of boot.

From the Boot Loader prompt, you can enter a number (***\<diskunit\>***)
and optionally a dot followed by a second number (***\<slice\>***).  The
***\<disk unit\>*** unit number refers to a disk unit that was displayed
when the system was booted -- essentially it specifies the specific
physical disk drive you want to boot.  The ***\<slice\>*** numbers refers
to a portion of the disk unit to boot.  If no slice is specified, then
it is equivalent to booting from the first slice (slice 0).  Disk units
and slices are described in more detail later.

Following this, you should see the operating system startup
messages. Your operating system prompt will typically be `A>` and
when you look at the drive letter assignments, you should see that A:
has been assigned to the disk and slice you selected to boot.

If you receive the error message "Disk not bootable!", you have
either failed to properly initialize the disk and slice requested
or you have selected an invalid/unavailable disk/slice.

The following example shows a disk boot into the first slice of disk
unit 4 which happens to be the CP/M 2.2 operating system on this disk.
This is accomplished by entering just the number '4' and pressing
***\<enter\>***.

```

Notice that a list of drive letters and their assignments to RomWBW
devices and slices is displayed during the initialization of the
operating system.

Here is another example where we are booting disk unit 4, slice 3
which is the CP/M 3 operating system on this disk:

```
Boot [H=Help]: 4.3

Some operating systems (such as CP/M 3 shown above) do not list the
drive assignments during initialization.  In this case, you can use the
`ASSIGN` command to display the current assignments.

The Boot Loader simply launches whatever is in the disk unit/slice you
have specified.  It does not know what operating system is at that
location.  The layout of operating systems on disk media is described in
the [Disk Images] section of this document.

### Auto-Submit Batch Files

All of the operating systems supplied with RomWBW have the ability to 
execute a "batch" of commands by creating a batch submission file 
containing the commands to be executed. The mechanism for running 
commands automatically at startup varies by operating system.  In some 
cases, it was built into the original operating system.  In other cases,
I have added this capability in the RomWBW BIOS of the operating 
system.

In all cases, the file containing the commands to run at startup must
be on the boot drive (A:).  RomWBW automatically assigns A: to the
disk slice you choose to boot.  Adding a startup command file to the
ROM Disk is not recommended because it would require customizing and
building a new ROM.  Use of bootable disk slices is preferred since
the startup command files can be added/edited without any special
system customization.

Here is an overview for each operating system:

- **CP/M 2.2** - Will run PROFILE.SUB as a SUBMIT file if it exists in
  A: at startup.  Note that original CP/M 2.2 itself did not have this
  ability -- it was added to the RomWBW CP/M 2.2 BIOS.  The use of SUBMIT
  files is documented in Section 1.6.7 SUBMIT Command of the CPM Manual 
  included in the Doc/CPM folder of the RomWBW distribution.

- **Z-System (ZSDOS 1.1)** - Will run run PROFILE.SUB as a SUBMIT file 
  if it exists in A: at startup.  Works exactly the same as CP/M 2.2.
  The original Z-System ZSDOS 1.1 did not have this ability -- it was
  added to the RomWBW Z-System BIOS.  The Z-System documentation does
  not cover the use of SUBMIT files -- please refer to the CP/M 2.2
  documentation.

- **NZCOM** - Will run the command STARTZCM at startup.  This is 
  normally an alias file.  You use SALIAS to edit such files.  Please see 
  Section 3.1 Creating an Alias of the NZCOM Users Manual included in the 
  Doc/CPM folder of the RomWBW distribution.  Note that the NZCOM 
  distribution includes a PROFILE.SUB file.  NZCOM itself is launched from 
  ZSDOS.  The included PROFILE.SUB accomplishes this.  Do not modify this 
  file unless you fully understand the NZCOM boot process.

- **CP/M 3** - Will run PROFILE.SUB as a SUBMIT file if it exists in A: 
  at startup.  This mechanism is built into the CP/M 3 operating system.  
  Please see Section 4.5 Executing Multiple Commands and Section 5.2.74 
  Executing the SUBMIT Command of the CPM3 Users Guide included in the 
  Doc/CPM folder of the RomWBW distribution.

- **ZPM3** - Will run the command STARTZPM at startup.  This is normally
  an alias file.  You use SALIAS to edit such files.  ZPM3 has no real 
  documentation.  The NZCOM documentation of STARTZCM is generally correct
  for ZPM3.

Since RomWBW can utilize many disk slices, it is very easy to create 
slices for specific workflows (editing, software development, games, 
etc.). You can then just boot to the slice that is optimized for the 
task you want to perform.  Each such slice may have its own startup
command batch file that customizes the environment for the specific
workflow desired.

## System Management

### Listing Device Inventory

The device units available in your system are listed in the
boot messages.  However, if that list has scrolled off of your
screen, you can use the 'D' command to display a list of them at
any time from the Boot Loader prompt.

```

### Rebooting the System

The 'R' command within the Boot Loader performs a software reset of
the system.  The system will perform a startup just like powering
up or pressing the hardware reset button (although the hardware is
not physically reset).

There is generally no need to do this, but it can be convenient when
you want to see the boot messages again or ensure your system is in
a clean state.

```
Boot [H=Help]: r

Restarting System...
```

### Changing Console and Console speed

Your system can support a number of devices for the console. They may
be VDU type devices or serial devices. If you want to change which
device is the console, the ***I*** menu option can be used to choose
the unit and its speed.

The command format is ```I <unit> [<baudrate>]```

where ***\<unit\>*** is the character unit to select and ***\<baudrate\>***
is the optional baud rate.

Supported baud rates are:
```
 75   450  1800   7200  38400  115200   460800  1843200
150   600  2400   9600  28800  153600   614400  2457600
225   900  3600  14400  57600  230400   921600  3686400
300  1200  4800  19200  76800  307200  1228800  7372800
```

Here is an example of changing the console to unit #1 (the second
serial port) and switching the port to 9600 baud:

```
Boot [H=Help]: i 1 9600

  Change speed now. Press a key to resume.

  Console on Unit #1
```

At this point, the Boot Loader prompt will be displayed on character
unit #1.

Note that not all character devices support changing baud rates and
some only support a limited subset of the baud rates listed.  If you
attempt to select an invalid baud rate for your system, you will get
an error message.

### HBIOS Diagnostic Verbosity

The 'V' command of the Boot Loader allows you to view and optionally
change the level of diagnostic messages that RomWBW will produce.
The normal verbosity level is 4, which means to display only fatal
errors.  You can increase this level to see more warnings when function
calls to RomWBW HBIOS detect problems.

The use of diagnostic levels above 4 are really intended only for
software developers.  I do not recommend changing this under
normal circumstances.

## Console Takeover

If your system has more than one character unit, then the Boot Loader 
will "poll" all of the character devices for a request to make any of 
the alternate character devices the active console.  This is called a 
console takeover request.  This functionality must be enabled in the ROM
build configuration, but currently it is for all standard ROMs.

To request a console takeover, you just press the \<space\> character 
twice in a row at the port or terminal that you want to move the console
to.  The terminal or communication software **must** be configured for 
the default serial port speed and data bits for this to work.

A takeover request is only possible while the active console is
showing the Boot Loader prompt prior to typing any characters at
the active console.  In other words, once you start typing at the
active console prompt, the takeover polling is suspended.  If you have
started typing characters, you can press \<enter\> at the active
console to get a fresh Boot Loader prompt and reactivate the polling.

If you have built a custom ROM that includes an automatic boot
command with a timeout, then performing a console takeover will
abort the timeout process and the automatic boot command will not be
performed.

## Front Panel

RomWBW supports the concept of a simple front panel.  The following 
image is a conceptual view of such a front panel.  If your system has a 
front panel, it should look similar to the [RomWBW Front Panel](#panel).

![RomWBW Front Panel](Graphics/Panel){#panel width=50% }

The LEDs in the top row of the panel are used for multiple purposes.
They are initially used to display the progress of the
system boot.  This may help in diagnosing a hardware or configuration
issue in a system that does not progress far enough to display text
output on the console.  The meaning of the LEDs is:

|            |                              |
|------------|------------------------------|
| `O-------` | System Boot has started      |
| `OO------` | Common RAM bank activated    |
| `OOO-----` | HBIOS transitioned to RAM    |
| `OOOO----` | Basic initialization done    |
| `OOOOO---` | CPU detection complete       |
| `OOOOOO--` | System timer configured      |
| `OOOOOOO-` | Pre-console device init done |
| `OOOOOOOO` | Console activation           |

Once the system has booted, the LEDs are used to indicate disk device
activity.  Each LED numbered 7-0 represents disk units 7-0.  As each
disk device performs I/O, the LED will light while the disk is active.
This is only possible for the first 8 disk units.

The second row of the front panel is composed of switches that allow
you to control a few aspects of the system startup.

The first two switches affect the device used as the console initially.
Setting the CRT/Serial switch will cause the system to boot directly 
to an attached CRT device (if available).  Setting the Pri/Sec switch 
will cause the system to boot to the secondary Serial or CRT device 
(depending on the setting of the first switch).

The final six switches allow you to cause the system to automatically
boot into a desired function.  The Auto/Menu switch must be set to
enable this, otherwise the normal ROM Loader prompt will be used.
If the Disk/ROM switch is not set, then you can use the last 3
switches to select a ROM app to auto-start.  If the Disk/ROM switch is
set, then the system will attempt a disk boot based on the following
switches.  The Floppy/Hard switch can be used to boot to a Floppy or
Hard Disk.  In either case, the first Floppy or Hard Disk will be used
for the boot.  If a Hard Disk boot is selected, then the last three
switches can be used to select any of the first 8 slices.

# Disk Management

The systems supported by RomWBW all have the ability to use persistent
disk media. A wide variety of disk devices are supported including
floppy drives, hard disks, CF Cards, SD Cards, etc.  RomWBW also
supports the use of extra RAM and ROM memory as pseudo-disk devices.

RomWBW supports a variety of storage devices which will be discussed
in more detail later.

* ROM Disk
* RAM Disk
* Floppy Disk
* Hard Disk (includes CF Cards, SD Cards, USB Drives, etc.)

We will start by discussing each of these types of storage devices and
how to prepare them so files can be stored on them.  Subsequently, we
will describe how to install the pre-built disk images with bootable
operating systems and ready-to-run content.

Some systems have disk interfaces built-in, while others will require
add-in cards. You will need to refer to the documentation for your
system for your specific options.

In the RomWBW boot messages, you will see hardware discovery messages.
If you have a disk drive interface, you should see messages listing
device types like FD:, IDE:, PPIDE:, SD:. Additionally, you will see
messages indicating the media that has been found on the interfaces.
As an example, here are the messages you might see if you have an IDE
interface in your system with a single CF Card inserted in the
primary side of the interface:

```
IDE: IO=0x80 MODE=MK4
IDE0: 8-BIT LBA BLOCKS=0x00773800 SIZE=3815MB
IDE1: NO MEDIA
```

The messages you see will vary depending on your hardware and the
media you have installed. But, they will all have the same general
format as the example above.

Once your system has working disk devices, they will be accessible
from any operating system you choose to run.  Disk storage is available
whether you boot your OS from ROM or from the disk media itself.

Referring back to [Starting Applications from ROM], you could start CP/M
2.2 using the 'C' command.  As the operating system starts up, you 
should see a list of drive letters assigned to the disk media you have 
installed. Here is an example of this:

```
Configuring Drives...

   A:=MD1:0
   B:=MD0:0
   C:=IDE0:0
   D:=IDE0:1
```

You will probably see more drive letters than this. The drive letter
assignment process is described below in the [Drive Letter Assignment]
section. Be aware that RomWBW will only assign drive letters to disk
interfaces that actually have media in them. If you do not see drive
letters assigned as expected, refer to the prior system boot messages
to ensure media has been detected in the interface. Actually, there
is one exception to this rule: floppy drives will be assigned a drive
letter regardless of whether there is any media inserted at boot.

Notice how each drive letter refers back to a specific disk hardware
interface like IDE0. This is important as it is telling you what each
drive letter refers to. Also notice that mass storage disks (like IDE)
will normally have multiple drive letters assigned. The extra drive
letters refer to additional "slices" on the disk. The concept of slices
is described below in the [Slices] section.

## Drive Letter Assignment

In legacy CP/M-type operating systems, drive letters were generally
mapped to disk drives in a completely fixed way. For example, drive A:
would **always** refer to the first floppy drive. Since RomWBW
supports a wide variety of hardware configurations, it implements a
much more flexible drive letter assignment mechanism so that any drive
letter can be assigned to any disk device.

At boot, you will notice that RomWBW automatically assigns drive
letters to the available disk devices. These assignments are
displayed during the startup of the selected operating system.
Additionally, you can review the current drive assignments at any
time using the `ASSIGN` command. CP/M 3 and ZPM3 do not automatically
display the assignments at startup, but you can use `ASSIGN` to
display them.  Refer to $doc_apps$ for more information on
use of the `ASSIGN` command.

Here is an example of the list of drive letter assignments made during
the startup of Z-System:

```
Loading Z-System...

CBIOS v3.1.1-pre.194 [WBW]

Formatting RAMDISK...

Configuring Drives...

        A:=MD0:0
        B:=MD1:0
        C:=FD0:0
        D:=FD1:0
        E:=IDE0:0
        F:=IDE0:1
        G:=IDE0:2
        H:=IDE0:3

        1081 Disk Buffer Bytes Free

ZSDOS v1.1, 54.0K TPA
```

Above you can see that drive A: has been assigned to MD0 which is the
RAM Disk device.  Drives C: and D: have been assigned to floppy drives.
Drives E: thru L: have been assigned to the IDE0 hard disk device.  The
4 entries for IDE0 are referring to 4 slices on that disk.  Slices are
discussed later.

**WARNING**: Drive letter assignments do **not** ensure that the slice
referenced by the drive letter actually fits on the media you are using.
For example, a typical 64MB CF Card (which is typically a bit smaller
than 64MB) will only fit 7 slices.  At startup, you will typically see
8 drive letters assigned to the CF Card.  Attempting to access the
last drive letter will result in a "no disk" error from the operating
system.

The drive letter assignments **do not** change during an OS session 
unless you use the `ASSIGN` command yourself to do it. Additionally, the
assignments at boot will stay the same on each boot as long as you do 
not make changes to your hardware configuration. Note that the 
assignments **are** dependent on the media currently inserted in hard 
disk drives when the operating system is started. So, notice that if you
insert or remove an SD Card, CF Card or USB Drive, the drive 
assignments will change. Since drive letter assignments can change, you 
must be careful when doing destructive things like using `CLRDIR` to 
make sure the drive letter you use is referring to the desired media.

When performing a ROM boot of an operating system, note that A: will
be your RAM disk and B: will be your ROM disk. When performing a disk
boot, the disk you are booting from will be assigned to A: and the
rest of the drive letters will be offset to accommodate this. This is
done because most legacy operating systems expect that A: will be the
boot drive.

### Default Drive Letter Assignment

As shown above, when an operating system is booted, RomWBW will 
automatically assign drive letters to physical disk devices.  The 
assignment process varies depending on: 1) the drive/slice you choose to
boot from, and 2) the number and type of physical drives in your 
system.

If you boot an operating system from ROM, then the first two drive
letters will be assigned to your RAM disk (A:) and your ROM disk (B:).
It may seem odd that the RAM disk is assigned to A: in this case.  The
reason for this is to accommodate certain functions that require that A:
be a writable disk drive.  For example, A: **must** be writable in order
to submit batch files.

If you boot to a physical disk device, then the first drive letter (A:) 
will be assigned to the disk/slice that you chose to boot from.  The A: 
drive letter is considered special by most operating systems and is 
automatically used in some cases.  By making the selected disk/slice the
A: drive, you can setup different disks/slices for specific uses and 
just boot to it.

After the first drive letter is assigned (as well as the second drive 
letter in the case of a ROM boot), RomWBW will assign additional drive 
letters based on the disk drives in the system.  Additional drive 
letters will be assigned in the following order:

- RAM Disk
- ROM Disk
- Floppy Disk(s)
- Hard Disk(s)

If a disk/slice was already assigned as the A: (or B:) drive letter, 
then it will not be assigned again.

In the case of floppy, RAM, and ROM disks, a single drive letter will be
assigned to each physical disk (even if there is no disk media in the 
drive).

In the case of hard disks, 1-8 drive letters will be assigned to the
initial 1-8 slices of the disk drive.  The number of drive letters
assigned to each hard disk depends on the number of hard disks in the
system:

- 1 Hard Disk: 8 drive letters (slices)
- 2 Hard Disks: 4 drive letters (slices) per disk
- 3+ Hard Disks: 2 drive letters (slices) per disk

This somewhat complicated algorithm is used to try and maximize the
limited number of operating system drive letters available (16) to
the available disk devices as evenly as possible.

Note that for hard disk devices, drive letters will only be assigned
to disk devices that actually contain media.  So, for example, if you
have an SD Card slot in your system, but it has no SD Card inserted, then
no drive letters will be assigned to it.

Since drive letter assignments are easily changed at any time using the 
`ASSIGN` command, you can customize your assignments as desired after 
starting the operating system.  Even better, you can use an auto-submit 
batch file to customzie the assignments at startup without any user 
intervention.

## ROM & RAM Disks

A typical RomWBW system has 512KB of ROM and 512KB of RAM.  Some
portions of each are dedicated to loading and running applications
and operating system.  The space left over is available for an
operating system to use as a pseudo-disk device (ROM Disk and RAM
Disk).

The RAM disk provides a small CP/M filesystem that you can use for the
temporary storage of files. Unless your system has a battery backed
mechanism for persisting your RAM contents, the RAM disk contents will
be lost at each power-off. However, the RAM disk is an excellent
choice for storing temporary files because it is very fast.  You will
notice that the first time an operating system is started after the
power was turned off, you will see a message indicating that the
RAM disk is being formatted.  If you reset your system without
turning off power, the RAM disk will not be reformatted and it's
contents will still be intact.

Like the RAM disk, the ROM disk also provides a small CP/M
filesystem, but it's contents are static -- they are part of the
ROM. As such, you cannot save files to the ROM disk. Any attempt to
do this will result in a disk I/O error. The contents of the ROM
disk have been chosen to provide a core set of tools and
applications that are helpful for either CP/M 2.2 or ZSDOS. Since
ZSDOS is CP/M 2.2 compatible, this works fairly well. However, you
will find some files on the ROM disk that will work with ZSDOS, but
will not work on CP/M 2.2. For example, `LDDS`, which loads the
ZSDOS date/time stamper will only run under ZSDOS.

Unlike other types of disk devices, ROM and RAM Disks do not contain an
actual operating system and are not "bootable".  However, they are
accessible to any operating system (whether the operating system is
loaded from ROM or a different disk device).

Neither RAM nor ROM disks require explicit formatting or initialization.
ROM disks are pre-formatted and RAM disks are formatted automatically
with an empty directory when first used.

#### Flash ROM Disks

The limitation of ROM disks being read-only can be overcome on some
platforms with the appropriate selection of Flash ROM chip and
system configuration. In this case the flash-file system can be
enabled which will allow the ROM disk to be read and written to.
Flash devices have a limited write lifespan and continual usage will
eventually wear out the device. It is not suited for high usage
applications.  Enabling ROM disk writing requires building a
custom ROM.

## Floppy Disks

If your system has the appropriate hardware, RomWBW will support the use
of floppy disks.  The supported floppy disk formats are generally
derived from the IBM PC floppy disk formats:

* 5.25" 360K Double-sided, Double-density
* 5.25" 1.2M Double-sided, High-density
* 3.5" 720K Double-sided, Double-density
* 3.5" 1.44M Double-sided, High-density

When supported, RomWBW is normally configured for 2 3.5" floppy drives.
If a high-density drive is used, then RomWBW automatically detects and
adapts to double-density or high-density media.  It cannot automatically
detect 3.5" vs. 5.25" drive types -- the ROM must be pre-configured
for the drive type.

Floppy media must be physically formatted before it can be used.  This 
is normally accomplished by using the supplied Floppy Disk Utility (FDU)
application.  This application interacts directly with your hardware 
and therefore you must specify your floppy interface hardware at 
application startup. Additionally, you need to specify the floppy drive 
and media format to use for formatting.

Below is a sample session using FDU to format a 1.44M floppy disk in
the first (primary) floppy disk drive:

Since the physical format of floppy media is the same as that used
in a standard MS-DOS/Windows computer, you can also physical format
floppy media in a modern computer.  However, the directory format
itself will not be compatible with CP/M OSes.  In this case, you
can use the `CLRDIR` application supplied with RomWBW to reformat
the directory area.

Once a floppy disk is formatted, you can read/write files on it
using any of the RomWBW operating systems.  The specific commands
will depend on the operating system or application in use -- refer to
the appropriate OS/application documentation as needed.

**WARNING:** Some of the operating systems provided with RomWBW require
that a soft-reset be performed when swapping floppy disk media.  For
example, under CP/M 2.2, you must press control-C at the CP/M prompt
after inserting a new floppy disk.  The consequences of failing to
perform the soft-reset vary from unexpected error messages to full
disk directory corruption.

## Hard Disks

Under RomWBW, a hard disk is similar to a floppy disk in that it is
considered a disk unit.  However, RomWBW has multiple features that
allow its legacy operating systems to take advantage of modern
mass storage media.

To start with, the concept of a hard disk in RomWBW applies to any
storage device that provides at least 8MB of space.  The actual
media can be a real spinning hard disk, a CompactFlash Card, a
SD Card, etc.  In this document, the term hard disk will apply
equally to all of these.

RomWBW uses Logical Block Addressing (LBA) to interact with all hard
disks.  The RomWBW operating systems use older Cylinder/Head/Sector
(CHS) addressing.  To accommodate the operating systems, RomWBW emulates
CHS addressing.  Specifically, it makes all hard disks look like they
have 16 sectors and 16 heads.  The number of tracks varies with the size
of the physical hard disk.

It is recommended that hard disk media used with RomWBW be 1GB or
greater in capacity.  The reasons for this are discussed later, but it
allows you to use the recommended disk layout for RomWBW that
accommodates 64 CP/M filesystem slices and a 384KB FAT filesystem.

>>> Although we have not yet discussed how to get content on your disk
>>> units, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of how RomWBW
>>> handles disk devices as background.  The following sections explain how
>>> disk units are managed within the operating systems.  We will
>>> subsequently discuss how to actually setup disk devices with usable
>>> content.

## Slices

The vintage operating systems included with RomWBW were produced at a
time when mass storage devices were quite small. CP/M 2.2 could only
handle filesystems up to 8MB. In order to achieve compatibility across
all of the operating systems supported by RomWBW, the hard disk
filesystem format used is 8MB. This ensures any filesystem will be
accessible to any of the operating systems.

Since storage devices today are quite large, RomWBW implements a
mechanism called slicing to allow up to 256 8MB CP/M filesystems on a
single large storage device.  To say it another way, the media is
"sliced up" into many 8MB CP/M filesystems.  Each slice is a complete
CP/M filesystem.  This allows up to 2GB of usable space on
one media. You can think of slices as a way to refer to any of
the first 256 8MB chunks of space on a single media.  Each chunk
is a CP/M filesystem.

Note that slices are **not** the same thing as a hard disk partition.
In fact, these slices all live inside of a single hard disk partition.
Normally, a RomWBW hard disk will have one partition (called the
RomWBW partition) containing 64 slices.  Optionally, there may be
a second partition which contains a FAT filesystem.  For now, we
are just talking about the slices within the single RomWBW partition.

Although you can use up to 256 slices per physical disk, this large 
number of slices is rarely used.  The recommended RomWBW disk layout 
provides for 64 slices which is more than enough for most use cases.

Of course, the problem is that CP/M-like operating systems have only
16 drive letters (A:-P:) available. Under the covers, RomWBW allows
you to use any drive letter to refer to any slice of any media. The
`ASSIGN` command is used to view or change the current drive letter
mappings at any time. At startup, the operating system will
automatically allocate a reasonable number of drive letters to the
available storage devices. The allocation will depend on the number of
mass storage devices available at boot. For example, if you have
only one hard disk type media, you will see that 8 drive letters are
assigned to the first 8 slices of that media. If you have two large
storage devices, you will see that each device is allocated 4 drive
letters.

Referring to slices within a storage device is done by appending a
`:<n>` where \<n\> is the device relative slice number from 0-255. 
For example, if you have an IDE device, it will show up as IDE0: in the 
boot messages meaning the first IDE device. To refer to the fourth slice
of IDE0, you would type "IDE0:3". Here are some examples:

|          |                              |
|----------|------------------------------|
| `IDE0:0` | First slice of disk in IDE0  |
| `IDE0:`  | First slice of disk in IDE0  |
| `IDE0:3` | Fourth slice of disk in IDE0 |

So, if you wanted to use drive letter L: to refer to the fourth slice of
IDE0, you could use the command `ASSIGN L:=IDE0:3`. There are a couple 
of rules to be aware of when assigning drive letters. First, you may 
only refer to a specific device/slice with one drive letter at a time. 
Said another way, you cannot have multiple drive letters referring to a 
the same device/slice at the same time. Second, there must always be a 
drive assigned to A:. Any attempt to violate these rules will be blocked
by the `ASSIGN` command.

As you see, the name of a slice does not reference the hard disk 
partition containing the slices.  Since there can only be a single 
RomWBW partition containing slices on any disk, the partition is 
determined automatically.

In case this wasn't already clear, you **cannot** refer directly
to slices using CP/M.  CP/M only understands drive letters, so
to access a given slice, you must assign a drive letter to it first.

While it may be obvious, you cannot use slices on any media less than 
8MB in size. Specifically, you cannot slice RAM disks, ROM disks, floppy
 disks, etc.  All of these are considered to have a single slice (slice 
0) and any attempt to ASSIGN a drive letter to a slice beyond that will 
fail and produce an error message.

It is very important to understand that RomWBW slices are not
individually created or allocated on your hard disk.  RomWBW uses a
single, large chunk of space (partition) on your hard disk to contain
the slices. You should think of slices as just an index into a
sequential set of 8MB areas that exist in this large chunk of space.
The next section will go into more detail on how slices are located on
your hard disk.

Although you do not need to allocate slices individually, you do need to
initialize each slice for CP/M to use it.  This is somewhat analogous
to doing a FORMAT operation on other systems.  With RomWBW you use the
`CLRDIR` command to do this. This command is merely "clearing out" the
directory space of the slice referred to by a drive letter and setting
up the new empty directory.  Since `CLRDIR` works on drive letters, make
absolutely sure you know what media and slice are assigned to that
drive letter before using `CLRDIR` because CLRDIR will wipe out any
pre-existing contents of the slice.

**WARNING**: Earlier versions of the `CLRDIR` application does not 
appear to check for disk errors when it runs.  If you attempt to run 
`CLRDIR` on a drive that is mapped to a slice that does not actually fit
on the physical disk, it may behave erratically.

Here is an example of using `CLRDIR`.  In this example, the `ASSIGN`
command is used to show the current drive letter assignments.  Then
the `CLRDIR` command is used to initialize the directory of drive 'G'
which is slice 2 of hard disk device IDE0 ("IDE0:2").

```

## Hard Disk Layouts

As previously discussed, when RomWBW uses a hard disk, it utilizes a
chunk of space for a sequential series of slices that contain the
actual CP/M filesystems referred to by drive letters.

Originally, RomWBW always used the very start of the hard disk media
for the location of the slices.  In this layout, slice 0 referred to
the first chunk of ~8MB on the disk, slice 1 referred to the second
chunk of ~8MB on the disk, and so on.  The number of slices is limited
to the size of the disk media -- if you attempted to read/write to a
slice that would exceed the disk size, you would see I/O errors.  This
is considered the "legacy" disk layout for RomWBW.

Starting with v3.2, RomWBW has been enhanced to support the concept of
partitioning.  The partition mechanism is entirely compliant with Master
Boot Record (MBR) Partition Tables introduced by IBM for the PC.  The
Wikipedia article on the
[Master Boot Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record)
is excellent if you are not familiar with them.  This is considered the
"modern" disk layout for RomWBW.  RomWBW uses the partition type id
0x2E.  This partition type id does not equate to any existing well-known
partition types -- it was chosen because it is not generally used.
RomWBW does not support extended partitions -- only a single
primary partition can be used.

Both the legacy and modern disk layouts continue to be fully supported
by RomWBW.  There are no plans to deprecate the legacy layout.  In fact,
the legacy format takes steps to allow a partition table to still be
used for other types of filesystems such as DOS/FAT.  It just does not
use a partition table entry to determine the start of the RomWBW slices.

There is one more difference between the legacy and modern disk layouts
that should be highlighted.  The CP/M filesystem in the slices of
the legacy disk layout contain 512 directory entries.  The modern disk
layout filesystems provide 1024 directory entries.  In fact, you will
subsequently see that the prefixes "hd512" and "hd1k" are used to
identify disk images appropriate for the legacy and modern format.
These prefixes were chosen specifically to highlight the number of
directory entries supported.

You **cannot** mix disk layouts on a single disk device.  To say it
another way, the existence of a partition table entry for RomWBW on
a hard disk makes it behave in the modern mode.  The lack of a RomWBW
partition table entry will cause legacy behavior.  Adding a partition
table entry on an existing legacy RomWBW hard disk will cause the
existing data to be unavailable and/or corrupted.  Likewise, removing
the RomWBW partition entry from a modern hard disk layout will cause
the same problems.  It is perfectly fine for one system to have
multiple hard disks with different layouts -- each physical disk
device is handled separately.

If you are setting up a new disk, the modern (hd1k) layout is
recommended for the following reasons:

* Larger number of directory entries per filesystem
* Simplifies creation of coresident FAT filesystem
* Reduces chances of data corruption

### Checking Hard Disk Layout

If you are not sure which hard disk layout was used for your existing
media, you can use the OSes command to display the number of directory
entries for a drive letter on the corresponding hard disk.  For example,
the `STAT` command is used in CP/M 2.2 to determine this.  This
command displays the number of directory entries on a filesystem.  If
it indicates 512, your disk layout is legacy (hd512).  If it indicates
1024, your disk layout is modern (hd1k).

Here is an example of checking the disk layout.  We want to check the
CompactFlash Card inserted in IDE interface 0.  We start the system
and boot to Z-System in ROM by using the 'Z' command at the Boot Loader.
As Z-System starts, we see the following disk assignments:

```
Boot [H=Help]: c

Loading CP/M 2.2...

CBIOS v3.1.1-pre.194 [WBW]

Configuring Drives...

        A:=MD0:0
        B:=MD1:0
        C:=FD0:0
        D:=FD1:0
        E:=IDE0:0
        F:=IDE0:1
        G:=IDE0:2
        H:=IDE0:3
        I:=PRPSD0:0
        J:=PRPSD0:1
        K:=PRPSD0:2
        L:=PRPSD0:3

        1081 Disk Buffer Bytes Free

CP/M-80 v2.2, 54.0K TPA
```

You can see that the IDE0 interface (which contains the CF Card) has
been assigned to drive letters E: to H:.  We can use the STAT command
on any of these drive letters.  So, for example:

```
B>stat e:dsk:

    E: Drive Characteristics
65408: 128 Byte Record Capacity
 8176: Kilobyte Drive  Capacity
 1024: 32  Byte Directory Entries
    0: Checked  Directory Entries
  256: Records/ Extent
   32: Records/ Block
   64: Sectors/ Track
    2: Reserved Tracks
```

It is critical that you include "dsk:" after the drive letter in the
`STAT` command line.  The important line to look at is labelled "32 Byte
Directory Entries".  In this case, the value is 1024 which implies that
this drive is located on a modern (hd1k) disk layout.  If the value
was 512, it would indicate a legacy (hd512) disk layout.

## Hard Disk Capacity

Although RomWBW can support many CP/M filesystem slices on a single
hard disk, you are still constrained by the physical capacity of the
actual hard disk.  RomWBW does not prevent you from assigning slices
to drive letters even if the location of the slice does not fit on the
physical disk.  Any attempt to access a drive letter mapped to a slice
that does not fit will result in an error such as "no disk" from the
operating system.

The exact number of CP/M filesystem slices that will fit on your 
specific physical hard disk can be determined as follows:

- For hd512 disk layouts, it is slices * 8,320KB.
- For hd1k disk layouts, it is 1024KB + (slices * 8192KB).  Since
  1024KB is exactly 1MB, it is equivalent to say 1MB + (slices * 8MB).

**WARNING**: In this document KB means 1024 bytes and MB means 1048576 
bytes (frequently expressed as KiB and MiB in modern terminology).
In general, hard disk capacities use KB to mean 1000 bytes and MB
to mean 1,000,000 bytes.

As an example, hardware distributors frequently supply a "64MB"
CF Card with a RomWBW system.  Such a hard disk probably has
less than 62.5MB of actual space (using the RomWBW definition that
1MB is 1048576 bytes).  Such a drive will not support 8 slices.  It
will support 7 slices just fine because 7 * 8,320KB = 58.24MB (hd512)
or 1024KB + (7 * 8192MB) = 57MB (hd1k).

The cost of high capacity CF/SD/USB Media has become very reasonable.
I highly recommend upgrading to 1GB or greater media.  This size will
support all features of the RomWBW Combo Disk Image with 64 slices
and a 384MB FAT filesystem (see [Combo Hard Disk Image]).

# Disk Content Preparation

With some understanding of how RomWBW presents disk space to the
operating systems, we need to go over the options for actually setting
up your disk(s) with content.

Since it would be quite a bit of work to transfer over all the files you
might want initially to your disk(s), RomWBW provides a much easier way
to get initial contents on your disks.  You can use your modern
Windows, Linux, or Mac computer to copy a disk image onto the disk
media, then just move the media over to your RomWBW computer. RomWBW
comes with a variety of disk images that are ready to use and have a
much more complete set of files than you will find on the ROM disk. This
process is covered below under [Disk Images].

If you do not want to start with pre-built disk images, you can
alternatively initialize the media in-place using your RomWBW system.
Essentially, this means you are creating a set of blank directories on
your disk so that files can be saved there.  This process is described
below under Disk Initialization. In this scenario, you will need to
subsequently copy any files you want to use onto the newly initialized
disk (see [Transferring Files]).

You will notice that in the following instructions there is no mention 
of specific hardware.  Because the RomWBW firmware provides a hardware 
abstraction layer, all disk images will work on all hardware variations.
Yes, this means you can remove disk media from one RomWBW system and 
put it in a different RomWBW system. The only constraint is that the 
applications on the disk media must be up to date with the firmware on 
the system being used.

## Disk Images

As mentioned previously, RomWBW includes a variety of disk images
that contain a full set of applications for the operating systems
supported. It is generally easier to use these disk images than
transferring your files over individually. You use your modern
computer (Windows, Linux, MacOS) to write the disk image onto the
disk media, then just move the media over to your system.

The disk image files are found in the Binary directory of the 
distribution. Floppy disk images are prefixed with "fd_" and hard disk 
images are prefixed with either "hd512_" or "hd1k_" depending on the 
hard disk layout they are for.

Each disk image has the complete set of normal applications and tools 
distributed with the associated operating system or application suite.
The following table shows the disk images available.

| **Disk Image**  | **Description**                        | **Boot** |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| xxx_cpm22.img   | DRI CP/M 2.2 Operating System          | Yes      |
| xxx_zsdos.img   | ZCPR-DJ & ZSDOS 1.1 Operating System   | Yes      |
| xxx_nzcom.img   | NZCOM ZCPR 3.4 Operating System        | Yes      |
| xxx_cpm3.img    | DRI CP/M 3 Operating System            | Yes      |
| xxx_zpm3.img    | ZPM3 Operating System                  | Yes      |
| xxx_qpm.img     | QPM Operating System                   | Yes      |
| xxx_dos65.img   | DOS/65 Operating System                | Yes      |
| xxx_ws4.img     | WordStar v4 & ZDE Applications         | No       |

You will find 3 sets of these .img files in the distribution.  The
"xxx" portion of the filename will be "fd_" for a floppy image,
"hd512" for a legacy layout hard disk image, and "hd1K" for a modern
layout hard disk image.

In the case of xxx_dos65.img, only an hd512 variant is provided.  This
is a constraint of the DOS65 distribution.

There is also an image file called "psys.img" which contains a bootable 
p-System hard disk image.  It contains 6 p-System filesystem slices, but
these are not interoperable with the CP/M slices described above.  This
file is discussed separately under p-System in the [Operating Systems] 
section.

### Floppy Disk Images

The floppy disk images are all intended to be used with 3.5" high-density,
double-sided 1.44 MB floppy disk media.  This is ideal for the default
floppy drive support included in RomWBW standard ROMs.

For floppy disks, the .img file is written directly to the floppy media 
as is.  The floppy .img files are 1.44 MB which is the exact size of a 
single 3.5" high density floppy disk.  You will need a floppy disk
drive of the same type connected to your modern computer to write this
image.  Although modern computers do not come equipped with a floppy
drive, you can still find USB floppy drives that work well for this.

The floppy disk must be physically formatted **before** writing the
image onto it.  You can do this with RomWBW using FDU as described
in the [Floppy Disks] section of this document.  You can also format
the floppy using your modern computer, but using FDU on RomWBW is
preferable because it will allow you to use optimal physical sector
interleaving.  FDU defaults to a sector interleave of 2 which will
result in faster floppy disk I/O.  Other interleaves will work, but
will be slower.

RomWBW includes a Windows application called RawWriteWin in the Tools 
directory of the distribution.  This simple application will let you 
choose a file and write it to an attached floppy drive. For Linux/MacOS,
I think you can use the dd command (but I have not actually tried 
this).  It is probably obvious, but writing an image to a floppy disk 
will overwrite and destroy all previous contents.

Once the image has been written to the floppy disk, you can insert
the floppy disk in your RomWBW floppy disk and read/write files
on it according to the specific operating system instructions.  If the
image is bootable, then you will be able to boot from it by entering
the floppy drive's corresponding unit number at the RomWBW Boot Loader
command prompt.

### Hard Disk Images

Keeping in mind that a RomWBW hard disk (including CF/SD/USB devices)
allows you to have multiple slices (CP/M filesystems), there are a
couple ways to image hard disk media.  The easiest approach is to 
use the "combo" disk image.  This image is already prepared
with 6 slices containing 5 ready-to-run OSes and a slice with
the WordStar application files.  Alternatively, you can create your own
hard disk image with the specific slice contents you choose.

#### Standard Hard Disk Physical Layout

As previously described in [Hard Disk Layouts], the exact placement of
slices and optional FAT partition will vary depending on which disk
layout (hd512 or hd1k) you are using and your partition table entries.
To simplify the use of hard disk images, RomWBW has adopted standard
partition table entries for disk image files provided.

These partition sizes and locations were chosen to:

- Fit entirely on 1GB media
- Allow for 64 CP/M filesystem slices
- Allow for a 384KB FAT filesystem

**NOTE:** RomWBW is not limited to these partition table entries.  You 
can change the size and location of the RomWBW and/or FAT partitions to 
increase/decrease the number of slices or FAT filesystem size.

#### Combo Hard Disk Image

The combo disk image is essentially just a single image that has several
of the individual filesystem images (slices) already concatenated 
together. The combo disk image contains the following 6 slices in the 
positions indicated:

You will notice that there are actually 2 combo disk images in the 
distribution.  One for an hd512 disk layout (hd512_combo.img) and one 
for an hd1k disk layout (hd1k_combo.img). Simply use the image file that
corresponds to your desired hard disk layout.  Review the information
in [Hard Disk Layouts] if you need more information of the disk layout
options.

Although the combo disk images contain only 6 slices of content, they
reserve space to store 64 CP/M filesystem slices as well as a
single 384MB FAT filesystem.  Keep in mind that the slices beyond the
first 6 are not yet initialized.  You will need to use the `CLRDIR`
application to initialize them before their first use.  Likewise, the
pre-allocated FAT partition must still be formatted using `FAT FORMAT`
in order to actually use it (see [FAT Filesystem Preparation]).
Alternatively, the FAT partition can be formatted on a modern computer.

The combo disk image layout was designed to fit well on a 1GB hard disk.
The 64 CP/M slices (approximately 512MB) and 384MB FAT filesystem all 
fit well within a 1GB hard disk.  This size choice was a bit arbitrary, 
but based on the idea that 1GB CF/SD/USB Media is easy and cheap to 
acquire.  It is fine if your hard disk is smaller than 1GB.  It just 
means that it will not be possible to use the pre-allocated FAT 
filesystem partition and any CP/M filesystem slices that don't fit.  You
will get "no disk" errors if you attempt to access a slice past the 
end of the physical hard disk.

**WARNING**: Your hard disk may be too small to contain the full 64
CP/M filesystem slices.  The true number of CP/M filesystem slices that
will fit on your specific physical hard disk can be calculated as
described in [Hard Disk Capacity].

For RomWBW systems with a single hard disk (typical), you will notice 
that the OS will pre-allocate 8 drive letters to the hard disk.  If the 
combo disk image is being used, only the first 6 drive letters 
(typically C: - H:) will have any content because the combo disk image 
only provides 6 slices. The subsequent drives (typically I: - J:) will 
have no content and will not be pre-initialized.  If you want to use any
slices beyond the first 6 on the hard disk, then you must initialize 
them using `CLRDIR` first.

A great way to maintain your own data on a hard disk is to put this
data in slices beyond the first 6.  By doing so, you can always
"re-image" your drive with the combo image without overlaying the data
stored in the slices beyond the first 6.  Just be very careful to use
the same combo image layout (hd512 or hd1k) as you used originally.
Also remember to calculate the maximum number of slices your hard disk
will support and do not exceed this number.

**WARNING**: The combo disk image includes a partition table at the 
start of the image.  If you re-image drive with the combo image, you 
will overwrite this partition table.  This is fine as long as you don't 
make any changes to the partition table.  If you manually customize the 
partition table (using `FDISK80` or other partition management 
software), those changes will be lost if you re-image your disk with a 
new combo disk image.

#### Custom Hard Disk Image

For hard disks, each .img file represents a single slice (CP/M 
filesystem).  Since a hard disk can contain many slices, you can just 
concatenate the slices (.img files) together to create your desired hard
disk image.  

If you look in the Binary directory of the distribution, you will see
that there are more disk (slice) images than the 6 that are included
in the "combo" disk images.  These images are identified by looking
for the files that start with hd1k_ or hd512_.

You can add slices to the combo disk images simply by tacking
slices onto the end.  For example, if you want to add a slice
containing the MSX ROMs to the end of the combo image, you could
use one of the following command lines depending on your operating
system:

Windows:

`COPY /B hd1k_combo.img + hd1k_msxroms.img my_hd.img` 

Linus/MaxOS:

`cat hd1k_combo.img hd1k_msxroms.img >my_hd.img`

Note that you **must** be sure to use either the hd1k_ or hd512_
prefixed files together.  You cannot mix them.

If you want to create a completely custom hard disk image that is not
based on the existing combo image, you can generate a disk image entirely
from scratch using whatever slices you want in whatever order you like.

For example, if you want to create a hard disk image that 
has slices for CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3, and WordStar in the hd512 format, you 
would use the command line of your modern computer to create the final 
image:

Windows:

`COPY /B hd512_cpm22.img + hd512_cpm3.img + hd512_ws hd.img`

Linux/MacOS:

`cat hd512_cpm22.img hd512_cpm3.img hd512_ws >hd.img`

**NOTE:** For the hd1k disk layout, you **must** prepend the 
prefix file called hd1k_prefix.dat which contains the required
partition table.  So, for an hd1k layout you would use the following:

Windows:

`COPY /B hd1k_prefix.dat + hd1k_cpm22.img + hd1k_cpm3.img + hd1k_ws hd.img`

Linux/MacOS:

`cat hd1k_prefix.dat hd1k_cpm22.img hd1k_cpm3.img hd1k_ws >hd.img`

In all of the examples above, the resulting file (hd.img) would now be 
written to your hard disk media and would be ready to use in a RomWBW 
system.

If you wish to further customize or create new disk image definitions,
please refer to the ReadMe.txt file in the Source/Images directory.

#### Writing Hard Disk Images

Once you have chosen a combo hard disk image file or prepared your own 
custom hard disk image file, it will need to be written to the media 
using your modern computer.  Note that you **do not** run `CLRDIR` or 
`SYSCOPY` on the slices that contain the data.  When using this method, 
the disk will be partitioned and setup with 1 or more slices containing 
ready-to-run bootable operating systems.  You **do** need to run
`CLRDIR` and optionally `SYSCOPY` on slices that are not part of the
image (slices beyond the ones included with the image).

To write a hard disk image file onto your actual media (actual hard disk
or CF/SD/USB Media), you need to use an image writing utility on your 
modern computer. Your modern computer will need to have an appropriate 
interface or slot that accepts the media. To actually copy the image, 
you can use the `dd` command on Linux or MacOS. On Windows, in the 
"Tools" directory of the distribution, there is an application called 
Win32DiskImager. In all cases, the image file should be written to the 
media starting at the very first block or sector of the media.

You are not limited to the number of slices that are contained in the 
image that you write to your hard disk media.  You can use additional 
slices as long your media has room for them.  However, writing the disk 
image will not initialize the additional slices.  If these additional 
slices were previously initialized, they will not be corrupted when you 
write the new image and will still contain their previous contents.  If 
the additional slices were not previously initialized, you can use 
`CLRDIR` to do so and optionally `SYSCOPY` if you want them to be 
bootable.

To be entirely clear, writing a disk image file to your hard disk media
will overwrite an pre-existing partition table and the number of slices
that your image file contains.  It will not overwrite or corrupt slices
beyond those in the image file.  As a result, you can use additional
slices as a place to maintain your personal data because these slices
will survive re-imaging of the media.  If you setup a FAT partition
on your media, it will also survive the imaging process.

**WARNING**: In order for your additional slices and/or FAT partition to
survive re-imaging, you **must** follow these rules:

* Do not modify the partition table of the media using FDISK80 or any
  other partition management tools.
* Ensure that your hard disk image file uses the same disk layout
  approach (hd512 or hd1k) as previously used on the media.

Once you have copied the image onto the hard disk media, you can
move the media over to your RomWBW system.  You can then boot to the
operating system slices by specifying "<unitnum>.<slicenum>" at the
RomWBW Boot Loader command prompt.

## In-situ Disk Preparation

If you do not wish to use the pre-built disk images, it is entirely
possible to setup your disks manually and transfer contents to them.

In this scenario, you will initialize the disk media entirely from
your RomWBW system.  So, you need to start by inserting the disk
media, booting RomWBW, and confirming that the media is being
recognized.  If RomWBW recognizes the media, it will indicate this
in the boot messages even though the media has not yet been prepared
for use.

The following instructions are one way to proceed.  This does not mean
to imply it is the only possible way.  Also, note that RAM/ROM disk
media is prepared automatically.  ROM disks are part of the ROM image
and RAM disks are initialized when an operating system is started.

Start by booting RomWBW and launching either CP/M 2.2 or Z-System
from ROM using the Boot Loader 'C' or 'Z' commands respectively.  You
can now use the tools on the ROM disk to prepare your disks.  Note
that you will see the operating system assign disks/slices to
drives even though the disks/slices are not yet initialized.  This is
normal and does not mean the disks/slices are ready to use.

Preparation of floppy disk media is very simple.  The floppy disk must 
be physically formatted as discussed in [Floppy Disks] previously using 
`FDU`. If a floppy is already physically formatted, you can wipe out 
it's contents (make it empty again) by running `CLRDIR` on it.  You can 
confirm a floppy disk is ready for content by simply running a `DIR` 
command on it.  The `DIR` command should complete without error and 
should list no files.  At this point, you can  proceed to copy files to 
the floppy disk and (optionally) make the floppy bootable using 
`SYSCOPY`.

The rest of this section will cover preparation of hard disk media.  To
start, it is critical that you decide which disk layout approach to use
(either hd512 or hd1k).  Review the [Hard Disk Layouts] section if you
are not sure.

#### Partition Setup

**WARNING**: Modifying the partition table of existing media will
make the data on the media inaccessible.

Since the disk layout is determined by the existence (or lack) of
a RomWBW partition, you must start by running `FDISK80`.  When FDISK80
starts, enter the disk unit number of the new media.  At this point,
use the 'I' command to initialize (reset) the partition table to an
empty state.  If you are going to use the hd512 layout, then use 'W' to
write the empty table to the disk and exit.  Remember that the lack of a
partition for RomWBW implies the legacy (hd512) layout.

If you are going to use an hd1k layout, then you must create a partition
for the RomWBW CP/M slices.  The partition can be placed anywhere you 
want and can be any size >= 8MB.  Keeping the size of the partition to 
increments of 8MB makes sense.  The partition type **must** be set to 
'2e'.  The typical location for the RomWBW partition is at 1MB with a 
size of 512MB (64 slices).  Below is an example of creating a RomWBW 
partition following these guidelines.

```
FDISK80 for RomWBW, UNA, Mini-M68k, KISS-68030, SBC-188  ----

 4             00       *** empty ***
>>w
Do you really want to write to disk? [N/y]: y
Okay
FDISK exit.
```

At this point, it is best to restart your system to make sure that
the operating system is aware of the partition table updates.  Start
CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from ROM again.

You are now ready to initialize the individual slices of your hard disk 
media.  On RomWBW, slice initialization is done using the CLRDIR 
application.  Since the CLRDIR application works on OS drive letters, 
you must pay attention to how the OS drive letters are mapped to your 
disk devices which is listed when the OS starts.  Let's assume that C: 
has been assigned to slice 0 of the disk you are initializing.  You 
would use `CLRDIR C:` to initialize C: and prepare it hold files. Note 
that CLRDIR will prompt you for confirmation and you must respond with a
**capital** 'Y' to confirm.

After CLRDIR completes, the slice should be ready to use by the operating
system via the drive letter assigned.  Start by using the `DIR` command
on the drive (`DIR C:`).  This should return without error, but list
no files.  Next, use the `STAT` command to confirm that the disk is
using the layout you intended.  For example, use `STAT C:DSK:` and
look at the number of "32  Byte Directory Entries".  It should say
512 for a legacy (hd512) disk layout and 1024 for a modern (hd1024)
disk layout.

Assuming you want to use additional slices, you should initialize them
using the same process.  You may need to reassign OS drive letters to
access some slices that are beyond the ones automatically assigned.
You can use the `ASSIGN` command to handle this.

Once you have your slice(s) initialized, you can begin transferring 
files to the associated drive letters.  Refer to the [Transferring 
Files] chapter for options to do this.  If you want to make a slice
bootable, you will need to use `SYSCOPY` to setup the system track(s)
of the slice.  The use of `SYSCOPY` depends on the operating system
and is described in the [Operating Systems] chapter of this document.

As an example, let's assume you want to setup C: as a bootable
Z-System disk and add to it all the files from the ROM disk.  To
setup the system track you would use:

```
B>SYSCOPY C:=B:ZSYS.SYS

SYSCOPY v2.0 for RomWBW CP/M, 17-Feb-2020 (CP/M 2 Mode)
Copyright 2020, Wayne Warthen, GNU GPL v3

Transfer system image from B:ZSYS.SYS to C: (Y/N)? Y
Reading image... Writing image... Done
```

Then, to copy all of the files from the ROM disk to C:, you could use
the `COPY` command as shown below.  In this example, the list of files
being copied has been truncated.

```
B>copy *.* m:
COPY  Version 1.73 (for ZSDOS)   2 Jul 2001
Copying B0:????????.??? to M0:
 -> ASM     .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok

 -> CLRDIR  .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok
 -> COMPARE .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok
 -> COPY    .COM..Ok  Verify..Ok
 -> CPM     .SYS..Ok  Verify..Ok
 0 Errors
```

Once this process succeeds, you will be able to boot directly to the
disk slice from the boot loader prompt. See the instructions in
[Starting Operating Systems from Disk] for details on this.

# Operating Systems

One of the primary goals of RomWBW is to expose a set of generic
hardware functions that make it easy to adapt operating systems to
any hardware supported by RomWBW. As a result, there are now 8
operating systems that have been adapted to run under RomWBW. The
adaptations are identical for all hardware supported by RomWBW
because RomWBW hides all hardware specifics from the operating system.

By design, the operating systems provided with RomWBW are original and 
unmodified from their original distribution.  Patches published by the 
authors are generally included or applied.  The various enhancements 
RomWBW provides (such as hard disk slices) are implemented entirely 
within the system adaptation component of each operating system (e.g.,
CP/M CBIOS).  As a result, each operating system should function
exactly as documented by the authors and retain maximum compatibility
with original applications.

Note that all of the operating systems included with RomWBW support the 
same basic filesystem format from DRI CP/M 2.2 (except for p-System). As
a result, a formatted filesystem will be accessible to any operating 
system. The only possible issue is that if you turn on date/time 
stamping using the newer OSes, the older OSes will not understand this. 
Files will not be corrupted, but the date/time stamps will not be 
maintained.

The following sections briefly describe the operating system options
currently available and brief operating notes.

## Digital Research CP/M 2.2

This is the most widely used variant of the Digital Research
operating systems. It has the most basic feature set, but is
essentially the compatibility metric for all other CP/M-like
operating systems including those listed below.

If you are new to the CP/M world, I would recommend using this CP/M 
variant to start with simply because it is the most stable and you are 
less likely to encounter compatibility issues.

#### Documentation

* [CPM Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/CPM Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To make a bootable CP/M disk, use the RomWBW `SYSCOPY` tool
to place a copy of the operating system on the boot track of
the disk.  The RomWBW ROM disk has a copy of the boot track
call "CPM.SYS".  For example:

`SYSCOPY C:=B:CPM.SYS`

#### Notes

* You can change media, but it must be done while at the OS
  command prompt and you **must** warm start CP/M by pressing
  ctrl-C.  This is a CP/M 2.2 constraint and is well documented
  in the DRI manual.

* `SUBMIT.COM` has been patched per DRI to always place submit
  files on A:.  This ensures the submitted file will always be
  properly executed.

* The original versions of DDT, DDTZ, and ZSID used the RST 38
  vector which conflicts with interrupt mode 1 use of this vector.
  The DDT, DDTZ, and ZSID applications in RomWBW have been modified
  to use RST 30 to avoid this issue.

* Z-System applications will not run under CP/M 2.2.  For example,
  the `LDDS` date stamper will not work.

## Z-System

Z-System is the most popular non-DRI CP/M workalike "clone" which is generally
referred to as Z-System. Z-System is intended to be an enhanced
version of CP/M and should run all CP/M 2.2 applications. It is
optimized for the Z80 CPU (as opposed to 8080 for CP/M) and has some
significant improvements such as date/time stamping of files.

Z-System is a somewhat ambiguous term because there are multiple 
generations of this software.  RomWBW Z-System is a combination of both 
ZCPR-DJ (the CCP) and ZSDOS 1.1 (the BDOS) when referring to Z-System. 
The latest version of Z-System (ZCPR 3.4) is also provided with RomWBW 
via the NZ-COM adaptation (see below).

#### Documentation

* [ZCPR Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/ZCPR Manual.pdf)
* [ZCPR-DJ]($doc_root$/CPM/ZCPR-DJ.doc)
* [ZSDOS Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/ZSDOS Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To make a bootable Z-System disk, use the RomWBW `SYSCOPY` tool
to place a copy of the operating system on the boot track of
the disk.  The RomWBW ROM disk has a copy of the boot track
call "ZSYS.SYS".  For example:

`SYSCOPY C:=B:ZSYS.SYS`

#### Notes

* Although most CP/M 2.2 applications will run under Z-System, some
  may not work as expected.  The best example is PIP which is not aware
  of the ZSDOS paths and will fail in some scenarios (use `COPY` instead).

* Although ZSDOS can recognize a media change in some cases, it will not
  always work.  You should only change media at a command prompt and be
  sure to warm start the OS with a ctrl-C.

* ZSDOS has a concept of fast relog of drives. This means that after a 
  warm start, it avoids the overhead of relogging all the disk drives. 
  There are times when this causes issues. After using tools like CLRDIR 
  or MAP, you may need to run “RELOG” to get the drive properly 
  recognized by ZSDOS.

* ZSVSTAMP expects to be running under the ZCPR 3.X command processor. 
  By default, RomWBW uses ZCPR 1.0 (intentionally, to reduce space usage) 
  and ZSVSTAMP will just abort in this case. It will work fine if you 
  implement NZCOM. ZSVSTAMP is included solely to facilitate usage 
  if/when you install NZCOM.

* Many of the tools can be configured (using either ZCNFG or DSCONFIG). 
  The configuration process modifies the actual application file itself. 
  This will fail if you try to modify one that is on the ROM disk because 
  it will not be able to update the image.

* DATSWEEP can be configured using DSCONFIG. However, DSCONFIG itself 
  needs to be configured first for proper terminal emulation by using 
  SETTERM. So, run SETTERM on DSCONFIG before using DSCONFIG to configure 
  DATSWEEP!

* Generic CP/M PIP and ZSDOS path searching do not mix well if you use 
  PIP to copy to or from a directory in the ZSDOS search path. Best to 
  use COPY from the ZSDOS distribution.

## NZCOM Automatic Z-System

NZCOM is a much further refined version of Z-System (ZCPR 3.4). NZCOM
was sold as an enhancement for existing users of CP/M 2.2 or ZSDOS.
For this reason, (by design) NZCOM does not provide a way to boot
directly from disk. Rather, it is loaded after the system boots into
a host OS. On the RomWBW NZCOM disk images, the boot OS is ZSDOS 1.1.
A `PROFILE.SUB` file is included which automatically launches NZCOM
as soon as ZSDOS loads.

NZCOM is highly configurable.  The RomWBW distribution has been
configured in the most basic way possible.  You should refer to the
documentation and use `MKZCM` as desired to customize your system.

NZCOM has substantially more functionality than CP/M or basic
Z-System.  It is important to read the "NZCOM Users
Manual.pdf" document in order to use this operating system effectively.

#### Documentation

* [NZCOM Users Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/NZCOM Users Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

Since NZ-COM boots via Z-System, you can make a bootable
NZ-COM disk using `ZSYS.SYS` as described in [Z-System] above.  You
will need to add a `PROFILE.SUB` file to auto-start NZ-COM itself.

#### Notes

* All of the notes for [Z-System] above generally apply to NZCOM.

* There is no `DIR` command, you must use `SDZ` instead.  If you don't
  like this, look into the `ALIAS` facility.

## Digital Research CP/M 3

This is the Digital Research follow-up product to their very popular 
CP/M 2.2 operating system. While highly compatible with CP/M 2.2, it 
features many enhancements and is not 100% compatible. It makes direct 
use of banked memory to increase the user program space (TPA). It also 
has a new suite of support tools and help system.

#### Boot Disk

To create (or update) a CP/M 3 boot drive, you must place `CPMLDR.SYS` on
the system track of the disk.  You must also place `CPM3.SYS` and 
`CCP.COM` on the target drive as regular files.  Do **not** place 
CPM3.SYS on the boot track.  `CPMLDR.SYS` chain loads `CPM3.SYS` which 
must exist as a regular file on the disk.  Subsequently, `CPM3.SYS` 
loads `CCP.COM`.

The CP/M 3 boot files are not included on the ROM disk due to
space constraints.  You will need to transfer the following files to
your system from the RomWBW distribution directory Binary/CPM3.  You
can use XModem for this (or any of the mechanisms in [Transferring
Files].

- `CPMLDR.SYS`
- `CPM3.SYS` or `CPM3BNK.SYS`
- `CCP.COM`

The `CPM3.SYS` boot file is provided in 2 versions.  In the Binary/CPM3 
distribution directory, `CPM3.SYS` is the "non-banked" version of
CP/M 3.  The `CPM3BNK.SYS` file is the "banked" version of CP/M 3.  You 
almost certainly want to transfer the banked `CPM3BNK.SYS` version.

After transferring the boot files to your RomWBW system, you will
need to use `SYSCOPY` to place `CPMLDR.SYS` on the boot track of the
target drive.  `CPM3.SYS` and `CCP.COM` can be copied to the target
drive using any standard file copy tool such as `PIP` or `COPY`.

You do not need to be booted into CP/M 3 to create or update a CP/M 3 
disk.  The recommended approach is to boot CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from 
ROM.  Transfer the boot files to the RAM disk.  Then simply copy the 
files onto the CP/M 3 disk.  Assuming the target CP/M 3 disk is F:, you 
can use the following commands to place the files on the target drive:

```
SYSCOPY F:=A:CPMLDR.SYS
COPY A:CPM3BNK.SYS F:CPM3.SYS
COPY A:CCP.COM F:
```

Note in the example above that `CPM3BNK.SYS` is renamed to `CPM3.SYS`
in the copy command.

#### Notes

- The `COPYSYS` command described in the DRI CP/M 3 documentation is
  not provided with RomWBW.  The RomWBW `SYSCOPY` command is used
  instead.

- Although CP/M 3 is generally able to run CP/M 2.2 programs, this is
  not universally true.  This is especially true of the utility programs
  included with the operating system.  For example, the `SUBMIT`
  program   of CP/M 3 is completely different/incompatible from the
  `SUBMIT` program of CP/M 2.2.

- RomWBW fully supports CP/M 3 file date/time stamping, but this 
  requires that the disk be properly initialized for it.  This process 
  has not been performed on the CP/M 3 disk image.  Follow the 
  CP/M 3 documentation to complete this process, if desired.

## ZPM3

Simeon Cran's ZPM3 is an interesting combination of the features of both
CP/M 3 and ZCPR3. Essentially, it has the features of and 
compatibility with both.

Due to this dual compatibility, the ZPM3 distribution image contains 
most of the standard CP/M 3 files as well as a variety of common ZCPR3 
applications.  However, you will notice that user area 0 of the disk has
only a few files.  Most of the files are distributed among other user 
areas which is standard practice for ZCPR3.  Most importantly, you will 
see most of the applications in user area 15.  The applications can be 
executed from any user area because ZPM3 has a default search path that 
includes User 15.

The ZPM3 distribution comes with essentially no utility programs at
all.  In addition to the standard CP/M 3 utilities, RomWBW includes
a variety of common ZCPR3 utilities.

#### Documentation

ZPM3 has no real documentation.  You are expected to understand both
CP/M 3 and ZCPR 3.

#### Boot Disk

To create (or update) a ZPM3 boot drive, you must place `ZPMLDR.SYS` on 
the system track of the disk.  You must also place `CPM3.SYS`, 
`ZCCP.COM`, `ZINSTAL.ZPM`, and `STARTZPM.COM` on the target drive as 
regular files.  Do **not** place CPM3.SYS on the boot track. 
`ZPMLDR.SYS` chain loads `CPM3.SYS` which must exist as a regular file 
on the disk.  Subsequently, `CPM3.SYS` loads `CCP.COM`.

The CP/M 3 boot files are not included on the ROM disk due to space 
constraints.  You will need to transfer the following files to your 
system from the RomWBW distribution directory Binary/ZPM3.  You can use 
XModem for this (or any of the mechanisms in [Transferring Files].

- `ZPMLDR.SYS`
- `CPM3.SYS`
- `ZCCP.COM`
- `ZINSTAL.ZPM`
- `STARTZPM.COM`

You may be surprised to see the file called `CPM3.SYS`.  This is not a 
typo. Although it is called `CPM3.SYS`, it is ZPM and not the same as 
`CPM3.SYS` in the CPM3 directory.  Also, unlike CP/M 3, ZPM3 is always 
banked, so you will not find two versions of the file.  `CPM3.SYS` is a 
banked implementation of ZPM3.

After transferring the boot files to your RomWBW system, you will
need to use `SYSCOPY` to place `ZPMLDR.SYS` on the boot track of the
target drive.  The remaining boot files can be copied to the target
drive using any standard file copy tool such as `PIP` or `COPY`.

You do not need to be booted into ZPM3 to create or update a ZPM3 
disk.  The recommended approach is to boot CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from 
ROM.  Transfer the boot files to the RAM disk.  Then simply copy the 
files onto the ZPM disk.  Assuming the target ZPM3 disk is F:, you 
can use the following commands to place the files on the target drive:

```
SYSCOPY F:=A:ZPMLDR.SYS
COPY A:CPM3.SYS F:CPM3.SYS
COPY A:CCP.COM F:
COPY A:ZINSTAL.ZPM F:
COPY A:STARTZPM.COM F:
```

#### Notes

- The ZPM3 operating system is contained in the file called CPM3.SYS 
  which is confusing, but this is as intended by the ZPM3 distribution.
  I believe it was done this way to make it easier for users to
  transition from CP/M 3 to ZPM3.

## QP/M

QP/M is another OS providing compatibility with and enhancements
to CP/M 2.2.  It is provided as a bootable disk image for RomWBW.

Refer to the ReadMe.txt file in Source/Images/d_qpm for more details
regarding the RomWBW adaptation and customizations.

#### Documentation

* [QP/M 2.7 Installation Guide and Supplements]($doc_root$/CPM/qpm27.pdf)
* [QP/M 2.7 Interface Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/qdos27.pdf)
* [QP/M 2.7 Features and Facilities]($doc_root$/CPM/qcp27.pdf)

#### Boot Disk


To create or update a bootable QP/M Z-System disk, a special process
is required.  QP/M is not provided in source format.  You are expected
to install QP/M over an existing CP/M installation using the
`QINSTALL.COM` application.

To update an existing QP/M boot disk with the latest RomWBW CBIOS, you
must use 2 steps: apply the generic CP/M system track, then reinstall
the QP/M components.  To do this, you can perform the following steps:

1. Boot to the existing QP/M disk.  At this point, drive A should be
   the QP/M disk that you wish to update.  You may receive a warning
   about CBIOS/HBIOS version mismatch.

1. Use RomWBW `SYSCOPY` to place the stock RomWBW CP/M OS image
   onto the system tracks of the QP/M boot disk:

   `SYSCOPY A:=x:CPM.SYS`

   where x is the drive letter of your ROM Disk.

1. Run `QINSTALL` to overlay the QP/M OS components on your
   QP/M boot disk.

**WARNING**: `QINSTALL` has no mechanism for retaining previous
non-default settings.  Any previous non-default settings you
previously made with `QINSTALL` will need to be reapplied.  The
pre-built RomWBW QP/M disk image includes a couple of specific
non-default settings to optimize use with RomWBW.  Please review the
notes in the ReadMe.txt file in Source/Images/d_qpm.

#### Notes

- QPM is not available as source.  This implementation was based
  on the QPM binary distribution and has been minimally customized
  for RomWBW.

- When booted, the QPM startup banner will indicate CP/M 2.2.  This
  is because QPM uses the CP/M 2.2 CBIOS code.

- QINSTALL is used to customize QPM.  It is included on the
  disk image.  You should review the notes in the ReadMe.txt
  file in Source/Images/d_qpm before making changes.

- In addition to the QPM disk image, all of the QPM distribution
  files can be found in the RomWBW distribution in the
  Source/Images/d_qpm/u0 directory.

- The QPM disk image is not included as one of the slices on the
  RomWBW combo disk image.  If you want to include QPM, you can do
  so by following the directions in Source/Images/Readme.txt.

## UCSD p-System

This is a full implementation of the UCSD p-System IV.0 for Z80
running under RomWBW.  Unlike the OSes above, p-System uses its
own unique filesystem and is not interoperable with other OSes.

It was derived from the p-System Adaptable Z80 System.  Unlike
some other distributions, this implements a native p-System
Z80 Extended BIOS, it does not rely on a CP/M BIOS layer.

The p-System is provided on a hard disk image file called
psys.img.  This must be copied to its own dedicated hard
disk media (CF Card, SD Card, etc.).  It is booted by
selecting slice 0 of the corresponding hard disk unit at
the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  Do not attempt to use
CP/M slices on the same disk.

Due to limitations in the p-System configuration mechanism, it does
not recognize the arrow keys of an ANSI Terminal.  To work around
this, the following control keys have been defined:

| Function   | Key        |
|------------|------------|
| Up         | ctrl+E     |
| Down       | ctrl+X     |
| Left       | ctrl+S     |
| Right      | ctrl+D     |

Refer to [Source/pSys/ReadMe.txt]($file_root$/Source/pSys/ReadMe.txt)
for more details about the p-System adaptation.

#### Documentation

* [UCSD p-System Users Manual]($doc_root$/UCSD p-System Users Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

There is no mechanism provided to create a p-System boot disk from
scratch under RomWBW.  This has already been done as part of the
porting process.  You must use the provided p-System hard disk image
file which is bootable.

#### Notes

* There is no floppy support at this time.

* The hard disk image contains 6 p-System slices which are
  assigned to p-System unit numbers 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12 which
  is standard for p-System.  Slices 0-5 are assigned
  sequentially to these p-System unit numbers and it is
  not possible to reassign them.  Unit #4 (slice 0) is
  bootable and contains all of the p-System distribution
  files.  Unit #5 (slice 1) is just a blank p-System filesystem.
  The other units (9-12) have not been initialized, but this
  can be done from Filer using the Zero command.

* p-System relies heavily on the use of a full screen
  terminal.  This implementation has been setup to expect
  an ANSI or DEC VT-100 terminal or emulator.  The screen
  output will be garbled if no such terminal or emulator
  is used for console output.

* There is no built-in mechanism to move files in
  and out of p-System.  However, the .vol files in Source/pSys
  can be read and modified by CiderPress.  CiderPress is able
  to add and remove individual files.

  Andrew Davidson has created a Python script that can extract p-System 
  volumes from an existing disk image file.  The script is also capable
  of inserting a modified volume back into the disk image file.
  This tool is available at
  <https://github.com/robosnacks/psysimg>.

## FreeRTOS

Phillip Stevens has ported FreeRTOS to run under RomWBW. FreeRTOS is
not provided in the RomWBW distribution. FreeRTOS is available under
the [MIT licence](https://www.freertos.org/a00114.html)
and further general information is available at
[FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html).

Phillip may be contacted via his
[GitHub Page](https://github.com/feilipu).

## Fuzix

Fuzix is a Unix-ish operating system for small systems.  It is the work 
of Alan Cox and is hosted on GitHub at
<https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX>. Fuzix itself is a stand-alone 
operating system, but it frequently utilizes RomWBW to boot and launch 
on RomWBW-supported platforms.

For those Fuzix platforms that leverage RomWBW for startup, you will
program your ROM with the normal RomWBW ROM -- there
is no Fuzix-specific ROM.  A Fuzix disk image for your system is then
written to your disk media.  After booting your system via the normal
RomWBW ROM, you start Fuzix simply by choosing the disk device
containing the Fuzix image at the RomWBW Loader prompt.

To create a Fuzix disk image:

* Locate and download the Fuzix disk image for your system from
  <https://www.fuzix.org/>.  For each platform, you will typically
  find two image files.  An emulator image (`emu-xxx.img`) and a
  disk image (`disk.img`).  You want the disk image file.

* Write the disk image file to your physical media (CF Card, SD Card,
  etc.) starting at the beginning of the media (first sector).  Do
  not combine the Fuzix image with the RomWBW disk images -- they are
  entirely separate.

To boot into Fuzix:

* Insert your Fuzix disk media.

* Power-up or reset your system.  RomWBW should load normally
  and bring you to the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.

* Depending on the platform, Fuzix may be built to run at a different
  baud rate that the default RomWBW baud rate.  If so, it is best to
  change your RomWBW baud rate prior to initiating the Fuzix startup.
  You can do this at the loader prompt with a command like this:

  `I 0 38400`

  Replace 38400 with the desired baud rate for Fuzix.  You will be
  prompted to change your terminal's baud rate at this time.

* At the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt, enter the disk unit number of
  the Fuzix media.  Fuzix should load and you will see device
  discovery/information messages that vary depending on your
  platform.  This is a typical example:

  ```
  RCBus [RCZ180_nat_wbw] Boot Loader
  FP Switches = 0x00

  Boot [H=Help]: 2

  Booting Disk Unit 2, Slice 0, Sector 0x00000000...

  Volume "Fuzix 126 Loader" [0xF200-0xF400, entry @ 0xF200]...
  FUZIX version 0.4

  bootdev:

  login:
  ```

* At the `login:` prompt, enter `root`.  No password is required.  You
  should then get a Fuzix `#` command prompt.

  ```
  login: root

  Welcome to FUZIX.
  #
  ```

You may now use Fuzix as desired.  The general operation and use of
Fuzix is outside of the scope of this document.

# Custom Applications

The operation of the RomWBW hosted operating systems is enhanced through
several custom applications. You have already read about one of these --
the `ASSIGN` command.  These applications are functional on all of the
OS variants included with RomWBW.

The applications discussed here are **not** the same as the built-in
ROM applications mentioned previously.  These applications run as
commands within the operating systems provided by RomWBW.  So, these
commands are only available at an operating system prompt after an
operating system has been loaded.

All of the RomWBW Custom Applications are built to function under all
of the RomWBW Operating Systems (except for p-System).  In general,
the applications will automatically adapt as needed to the currently
running operating system.  One exception is `FDU` -- the Floppy Disk
Utility.  This application requires that you pick the floppy disk
interface you want to interact with.

There is more complete documentation of all of these applications in
the related RomWBW manual "$doc_apps$" found in the Doc
directory of the distribution.

The following custom applications are found on the ROM disk and are,
therefore, globally available.

disk image files or the individual files can be found in the Binary/Apps
directory of the distribution.  They are also included on the
floppy disk and hard disk images.

# FAT Filesystem

The FAT filesystem format that originated with MS-DOS is almost
ubiquitous across modern computers.  Virtually all operating systems
now support reading and writing files to a FAT filesystem.  For this
reason, RomWBW now has the ability to read and write files on FAT
filesystems.

This is accomplished by running a RomWBW custom application called `FAT`.
This application understands both FAT filesystems as well as CP/M filesystems.

* Files can be copied between a FAT filesystem and a CP/M filesystem,
  but you cannot execute files directly from a FAT filesystem.
* FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 formats are supported.
* Long filenames are not supported.  Files with long filenames will
  show up with their names truncated into the older 8.3 convention.
* A FAT filesystem can be located on floppy or hard disk media.  For
  hard disk media, a valid FAT Filesystem partition must exist.
* Note that CP/M (and compatible) OSes do not support all of the
  filename characters that a modern computer does.  The following
  characters are **not permitted** in a CP/M filename:

  `< > . , ; : = ? * [ ] _ % | ( ) / \`

  The FAT application does not auto-rename files when it encounters
  invalid filenames.  It will just issue an error and quit.
  Additionally, the error message is not very clear about the problem.

## FAT Filesystem Preparation

In general, you can create media formatted with a FAT filesystem on
your RomWBW computer or on your modern computer.  We will only be
discussing the RomWBW-based approach here.

In the case of a floppy disk, you can use the `FAT` application to 
format the floppy disk.  The floppy disk must already be physically 
formatted using RomWBW FDU or equivalent.  If your floppy disk is on 
RomWBW disk unit 2, you could use `FAT FORMAT 2:`.  This will overwrite 
the floppy with a FAT filesystem and all previous contents will be lost.
Once formatted this way, the floppy disk can be used in a floppy drive 
attached to a modern computer or it can be used on RomWBW using the 
other `FAT` tool commands.

In the case of hard disk media, it is necessary to have a FAT
partition.  If you prepared your RomWBW hard disk media using the
disk image process, then this partition will already be defined and
you do not need to recreate it.  This default FAT partition is located
at approximately 512MB from the start of your disk and it is 384MB in
size.  So, your hard disk media must be 1GB or greater to use this
default FAT partition.

You can confirm the existence of the FAT partition with `FDISK80` by 
using the 'P' command to show the current partition table.  Here is an 
example of a partition table listing from `FDISK80` that includes the 
FAT partition (labelled "FAT16"):

```
Capacity of disk 4:  (  4G)  7813120      Geom 77381010
Nr  ---Type- A --      Start         End   LBA start  LBA count  Size
 1    RomWBW   2e      8:0:1  1023:15:16        2048    1048576  512M
 2     FAT16   06   1023:0:1  1023:15:16     1050624     786432  384M
 3             00       *** empty ***
 4             00       *** empty ***
```

If your hard disk media does not have a FAT partition already defined,
you will need to define one using FDISK80 by using the 'N' command.
Ensure that the location and size of the FAT partition does not
overlap any of the CP/M slice area and that it fits within the size
of your media.

Once the partition is defined, you will still need to format it.  Just
as with a floppy disk, you use the `FAT` tool to do this.  If your
hard disk media is on RomWBW disk unit 4, you would use `FAT FORMAT 4:`.
This will look something like this:

```
E>fat format 4:

About to format FAT Filesystem on Disk Unit #4.
All existing FAT partition data will be destroyed!!!

Continue (y/n)?

Formatting... Done
```

Your FAT filesystem is now ready to use.

If your RomWBW system has multiple disk drives/slots, you can also just 
create a disk with your modern computer that is a dedicated FAT 
filesystem disk.  You can use your modern computer to format the disk 
(floppy, CF Card, SD Card, etc.), then insert the disk in your RomWBW 
computer and access it using `FAT` based on its RomWBW unit number.

**WARNING**: Microsoft Windows will sometimes suggest reformatting 
partitions that it does not recognize.  If you are prompted to format a 
partition of your SD/CF/USB Media when inserting the card into a Windows
computer, you probably want to select Cancel.

## FAT Application Usage

Complete instructions for the `FAT` application are found in $doc_apps$.
Here, we will just provide a couple of simple examples.  Note that the 
FAT application is not on the ROM disk because it is too large to 
include there.

The most important thing to understand about the `FAT` application is
how it refers to FAT filesystems vs. CP/M filesystems.  It infers this
based on the file specification provided.  If you use a specification
like `C:SAMPLE.TXT`, it will use the C: drive of your CP/M operating
system.  If you use a specification like `4:SAMPLE.TXT`, it will use
the FAT filesystem on the disk in RomWBW disk unit 4.  Basically, if
you start your file or directory specification with a number followed
by a colon, it means FAT filesystem.  Anything else will mean CP/M
filesystem.

Here are a few examples.  This first example shows how to get a FAT
directory listing from RomWBW disk unit 4:

```
E>fat dir 4:

Directory of 4:


E>
```

As you can see, there are currently no files there.  Now let's copy
a file from CP/M to the FAT directory:

```
E>fat copy sample.txt 4:

Copying...

SAMPLE.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE.TXT ... [OK]

    1 File(s) Copied
```

If we list the FAT directory again, you will see the file:

```
E>fat dir 4:

Directory of 4:

01/30/2023  17:50:14         29952  ---A  SAMPLE.TXT

```

Now let's copy the file from the FAT filesystem back to CP/M.  This
time we will get a warning about overwriting the file.  For this
example, we don't want to do that, so we abort and reissue the
command specifying a new filename to use:

```
E>fat copy 4:sample.txt e:

Copying...

4:/SAMPLE.TXT ==> E:SAMPLE.TXT Overwrite? (Y/N) [Skipped]

    0 File(s) Copied

E>fat copy 4:sample.txt e:sample2.txt

Copying...

4:/SAMPLE.TXT ==> E:SAMPLE2.TXT ... [OK]

    1 File(s) Copied
```

Finally, let's try using wildcards:

```
E>fat copy sample*.* 4:

Copying...

SAMPLE.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE.TXT Overwrite? (Y/N) ... [OK]
SAMPLE2.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE2.TXT ... [OK]

    2 File(s) Copied
```

# Real Time Clock

RomWBW supports a variety of real time clock hardware.  If your
system has this hardware, then it will be able to maintain the
current date and time even while your system is turned off.

Additionally, depending on the operating system being used, you may be
able to utilize date/time stamping of files.
To facilitate this a CP/M clock driver (WBWCLK) has been included 
inside `CLOCKS.DAT` that will read the clock via a RomWBW HBIOS call

You can determine if your system has a real time clock present (and
functioning) by looking at the boot messages.  Here is an example of
a boot message reflecting the detection of a valid real time clock
module:

`DSRTC: MODE=STD IO=0x8A Thu 2023-10-19 14:07:11 CHARGE=ON`

This example is from a DSRTC clock module.  You may have a different
one, but it will always display the current date/time.

In some cases, your real time clock will support charging of the
battery or super-capacitor while the system has power.  The status of
this charging is displayed.

If the date/time of your RTC needs to be updated, you will need to do
this with one of the utilities described below.  There is no ability to
update the date/time of the RTC in the RomWBW Boot Loader or Monitor.

## Date/Time Utilities

RomwWBW includes two utilities for displaying or setting the date/time
stored by the RTC.  They are both a bit different and are briefly
described below.

A third utility `TESTCLOK` is also included as part of ZSDOS

### WDATE Utility

The `WDATE` utility (contributed by Kevin Boone) is an application
that will display and/or update the current date/time.  Its operation is
described in $doc_apps$.  This utility works with any of the supported
RomWBW RTC hardware.  Here is an example of displaying and updating the
date/time with this utility:

```
A>wdate
Thursday 19 October 14:14:43 2023

A>wdate 23 10 19 14 24 30

A>wdate
Thursday 19 October 14:24:34 2023

```

Note that `WDATE` does not have anything to do with date/time stamping
of files.  It merely displays and sets the real time clock value.

### RTC Utility

Like `WDATE`, the `RTC` utility (contributed by Andrew Lynch) will let
you display and set the current date/time.  However, this utility only
works with the DSRTC hardware (DS1302 chip).  It is a "direct to
hardware application".  Its operation is described in $doc_apps$.  Here
is an example of displaying and updatting the date/time with this
utility:

```
A>rtc
Start RTC Program
RomWBW HBIOS, Mark 4 RTC Latch Port 0x8A

RTC: Version 1.9
Commands: E)xit T)ime st(A)rt S)et R)aw L)oop C)harge N)ocharge D)elay I)nit G)et P)ut B)oot W)arm-start H)elp

RTC>t
Current time: 23-10-19 14:30:25-05

RTC>i
Init date/time.

YEAR:23
MONTH:10
DATE:19
HOURS:14
MINUTES:31
SECONDS:00
DAY:05
```

The `RTC` utility is also capable of turning the charging feature of
the DS1320 chip on or off.  Here is an example of turning if off and
back on:

```

A>rtc
Start RTC Program
RomWBW HBIOS, Mark 4 RTC Latch Port 0x8A


RTC: Version 1.9
Commands: E)xit T)ime st(A)rt S)et R)aw L)oop C)harge N)ocharge D)elay I)nit G)et P)ut B)oot W)arm-start H)elp

RTC>n
Trickle charger disabled.

RTC>c
Trickle charger enabled.
```

Do **not** enable charging unless you are sure that your system
supports this.  If your RTC is being powered by a normal battery, it
would be dangerous to enable charging.

### TESTCLOK Utility

The `TESTCLOK` utility is used to test a selected CPM clock driver 
loaded from the CLOCKS.DAT file. After selecting the location of CLOCKS.DAT 
and the clock driver (45. WBWCLK) it displays the currently configured time 
until a key is pressed.

Since this runs at the CPM driver level it is useful as an end-to-end test
to prove that date time stamping is able to read the correct time

The `TESTCLOK` utility is provided by ZSDOS, plese see the ZSDOS Manual 
for further information

## Date/Time File Stamping

If an RTC is available in your system, then most operating systems
can use it to date/time stamp files.  This just means recording the
date/time of file creation, update, and or access in the directory.
This capability is available in all of the RomWBW operating system
except the original DRI CP/M 2.2.

Three types of date/time stamping are supported using realtime clock 
supported by RomWBW HBIOS. DateStamper, NZT and P2DOS.

In some cases (such as ZSDOS), you must load an RSX (memory resident 
utility) to enable date/time stamping of files. This could be automated 
using a `PROFILE.SUB` file.
Preconfigured loaders are provided, bypassing the need to use SETUPZST.

Additionally, you will need to initialize the directory. The procedure varies
depending on the date/time stamping mechanism, so you must review the associated documentation.

The date/time stamping mechanisms for each operating system are
generally not compatible.  If you initialize a directory for a type
of stamping, you should be careful not to manipulate that directory
with a different operating system with a different date/time stamping
mechanism.  Doing so may corrupt the directory.

The RomWBW disk images do not have date/time stamping initialized.  This
is to avoid any chance of directory corruption.

### DateStamper

DateStamper datestamping follows the standard set by Plu*Perfect Systems. 
This method stores stamps in a disk file named `!!!TIME&.DAT`. 
Only DateStamper stamping stores full time and date stamps for
file Creation, Last Modification, and Last Access, 
and may be used with any CP/M diskette format. In addition, 
the DateStamper protocol is supported by a mature set of compatible utilities.

Key Utilities

* LDDS.COM - Load DateStamper date/time stamping resident extension. (RomWBW Provided)
* PUTDS.COM - Prepare disk for DateStamper date/time stamping.

After using PUTDS to initialize a directory for ZDS date stamping,
it may be necessary to run RELOG before the stamping routines 
will actually start working.

### P2DOS (CP/M Plus compatible)

CP/M Plus-type datestamping is also widely used due to the popularity 
of CP/M Plus (also know as CP/M 3). CP/M Plus-type file datestamping uses 
directory sectors to store file datestamps which may be accessed more quickly 
by programs, but there is no Last File Access stamp. Finally, the range of 
utilities for this type of stamps is more limited than for the DateStamper protocol.

Key Utilities

* LDP2D.COM - Load P2DOS date/time stamping resident extension. (RomWBW Provided)
* INITDIR.COM - Prepares disks for P2DOS-type file stamping.

### NZT

_The use of NZT needs to be further documented_

Key Utilities

* LDNZT.COM - Load NZT date/time stamping resident extension. (RomWBW Provided)

### Additional Notes

The following files have been provided, customised and tested for for use in RomWBW

* `CLOCKS.DAT` - Library of clock drivers, which has been updated to include 
   the RomWBW clock driver WBWCLK, and also includes the SIMHCLOK clock driver.
   The file is just a standard LU type library and is easily updated using NULU. 
   The members are the relocatable binaries, but with the .REL extension removed.
* `STAMPS.DAT` - Library of available date/time stamping modules for SETUPZST.
   The file has been replaced with an updated version from the Walnut Creek CP/M CDROM. 
   The original version has a bug that prevents RSX (resident system extension) mode 
   to load properly.

Additional Notes

* `SETUPZST` (provided by ZSDOS) Should not normally be needed since the 
   creation of the appropriate LDTIM loaders has already been performed.
* `FILEDATE` only works with DateStamper style date stamping. If you run
   it on a drive that is not initialized for DateStamper, it will complain
   `FILEDATE, !!!TIME&.DAT missing`. This is normal and just means that
   you have not initialized that drive for DateStamper (using PUTDS).
* `ZXD` will handle either DateStamper or P2DOS type date stamping.
   However, it **must** be configured appropriately. As distributed, it will
   look for P2DOS date stamps. Use ZCNFG to reconfigure it for P2DOS if
   that is what you are using.

## Timezone

None of the operating systems distributed with RomWBW have any concept
of timezone.  When files are date/time stamped, the date/time will
simply be whatever date/time the RTC currently has.

The normal practice is to set the RTC to your local time.  This implies
that you would need to manually adjust the RTC for daylight savings time
and/or when you travel to a different time zone.

The date/time stamps of files in directories will also be stored in
local time.  This includes files stored in a FAT filesystem.  If you
subsequently view the directory from modern machines (Windows, Linux,
etc.), the date/time displayed will depend on the behavior of the
modern system.

For example, Linux assumes that the date/time of files
is UTC.  So, if you create a file on a FAT filesystem with your RomWBW
computer and then use Linux to view the directory, the date/time stamps
will seem "off" by a few hours.

The only alternative you may consider is setting the date/time of your
RTC to UTC.  Since UTC is consistent across all timezones and daylight
savings time, your file date/time stamps will also be consistent.  Of
course, this will mean that your RomWBW computer will display a
date/time that seems wrong because it is not local time.

# CP/NET Networking

Digital Research created a simple network file sharing system called 
CP/NET.  This allowed a network server running CP/NOS to host files 
available to network attached CP/M computers.  Essentially, the host
becomes a simple file sharing server.

RomWBW disk images include an adaptation of the DRI CP/NET client 
software provided by Douglas Miller.  RomWBW does not support operation 
as a network server itself.  However, Douglas has also developed a 
Java-based implementation of the DRI network server that can be used to 
provide host services from a modern computer.

Both CP/NET 1.2 and 3.0 clients are provided.  Version 1.2 is for use 
with CP/M 2.2 and compatible OSes.  Version 3.0 is for use with CP/M 3 
and compatible OSes.

The CP/NET client software provided with RomWBW requires a supported
ethernet interface module.  At this time, the following are supported:

* RCBus MT011 w/ Ethernet Featherwing and (optionally) SPI FRAM
  (e.g., Adafruit SPI Non-Volatile FRAM Breakout)
* Duodyne Disk I/O w/ Wiz850IO and (optionally) SPI NVRAM
  (e.g., 25LC256)
* Generic Serial Interface

**NOTE:** The Generic Serial Interface is supported by RomWBW, but is
not documented here.  You must refer to the CP/NET documentation
referenced below.

The client software interacts directly with this hardware.  In a future 
version of RomWBW, I hope to add a generic networking API that will 
allow a greater range of network hardware to be used.

To use CP/NET effectively, you will want to review the documentation 
provided by Douglas on at his
[cpnet-z80 GitHub Project](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80). 
Additionally, you should consult the DRI documentation which is not 
included with RomWBW, but is available on the
[cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site.

Below, I will provide the general steps involved in setting up a
network using MT011 with RomWBW.

## CP/NET Client Setup

The CP/NET client files are included on the RomWBW disk images, but
they are found in user area 4.  They are placed there to avoid
confusing anyone that is not specifically trying to run a network
client.  They are only found on the CPM 2.2 and CP/M 3 slices.  Using
CP/NET on alternative OSes may work, but is not officially supported.

The CP/NET client files are packaged in `.LBR` library files.  The
library files are found in user area 4.

| File         | CP/NET Version | OS       | Hardware              |
|--------------|----------------|----------|-----------------------|
| CPN12MT.LBR  | CP/NET 1.2     | CP/M 2.2 | RCBus w/ MT011        |
| CPN3MT.LBR   | CP/NET 3       | CP/M 3   | RCBus w/ MT011        |
| CPN12DUO.LBR | CP/NET 1.2     | CP/M 2.2 | Duodyne w/ Disk I/O   |
| CPN3DUO.LBR  | CP/NET 3       | CP/M 3   | Duodyne w/ Disk I/O   |
| CPN12SER.LBR | CP/NET 1.2     | CP/M 2.2 | RomWBW Serial Port    |
| CPN3SER.LBR  | CP/NET 3       | CP/M 3   | RomWBW Serial Port    |

First, you need to merge the files from the correct library file
into user area 0.  This is done by extracting the files using the
`NULU` library management utility application.

1. Start NULU specifying desired CP/NET library for \<filename\>:

   `A>NULU 4:<filename>`

2. At the NULU prompt, extract the files using the `-E *.*` command:

   `-READY A0:>-E *.*`

3. Exit NULU using the `-X` command:

   `-Extract members A0:>-x`

Here is an example of extracting the CP/NET 1.2 client files for an 
RCBus system w/ MT011.  You should be in user area 0 when performing 
this operation.

```

```



At this point, you will need to configure your ethernet adapter for your
 local network using `WIZCFG`.  The definitive guide to the use of 
`WIZCFG` is on the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80)
site in the document called "CPNET-WIZ850io.pdf". Here is an example of
the commands needed to configure the WizNet:

|                                    |                                        |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `wizcfg w n F0`                    | set CP/NET node id                     |
| `wizcfg w i 192.168.1.201`         | set WizNet IP address                  |
| `wizcfg w g 192.168.1.1`           | set local network gateway IP address   |
| `wizcfg w s 255.255.255.0`         | set WizNet subnet mask                 |
| `wizcfg w 0 00 192.168.1.3 31100`  | set server node ID, IP address, & port |

You will need to use values appropriate for your local network.  You can
use the command `wiznet w` to display the current values which is 
useful to confirm they have been set as intended.

```
A>wizcfg w
Node ID:  F0H
IP Addr:  192.168.1.201
Gateway:  192.168.1.1
Subnet:   255.255.255.0
MAC:      98:76:B6:11:00:C4
Socket 0: 00H 192.168.1.3 31100 0
```

These values can be persisted across power-cycles if your system has
NVRAM storage.  To program the values into your NVRAM, you would use
the same commands as above, but omit the `w` parameter.  The
"CPNET-WIZ850io.pdf" document is highly recommended to understand the
operation of `WIZCFG`.

If you do not utilize NVRAM to persist your configuration, you will need
to reapply these commands every time you power cycle your RomWBW 
computer, so I recommend putting them into a `SUBMIT` file.

After applying these commands, you should be able ping the WizNet from
another computer on the local network.  If this works, then the 
client-side is ready.

## CP/NET Sever Setup

These instructions will assume you are using Douglas Miller's 
CpnetSocketServer to implement a CP/NOS server on your network.  The 
definitive guide to this software is also on the [cpnet-z80] 
(https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site and is called 
"CpnetSocketServer.pdf".

The software is a Java application, so it can generally run anywhere
there is a Java runtime environment available.  I have normally used
it on a Linux system and have had good results with that.

You will need to download the application called "CpnetSocketServer.jar"
from the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site. The
application uses a configuration file.  My configuration file is called
"cpnet00.rc" and has these contents:

```
cpnetserver_host = 192.168.1.3
cpnetserver_port = 31100
cpnetserver_temp = P
cpnetserver_sid = 00
cpnetserver_max = 16
cpnetserver_root_dir = /home/wayne/cpnet/root
```

You will also need to setup a directory structure with the drive
letters per the documentation.

To start the server, you would use a command like this:

`java -jar CpnetSocketServer.jar conf=cpnet00.rc`

At this point, the server should start and you should see the following:

```
CpnetSocketServer v1.3
Using config in cpnet00.rc
Server 00 Listening on 192.168.1.3 port 31100 debug false
```

Your CP/NET server should now be ready to accept client connections.

## CP/NET Usage

With both the client and server configured, you are ready to load and
use CP/NET on your RomWBW system.  CP/NET documentation is available
on the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site.
The document is called "dri-cpnet.pdf".

Under CP/M 2.2, you will start the networking client using the command 
`CPNETLDR`.  Under CP/M 3, you use the command `NDOS3`. If that works, 
you can map network drives as local drives using the `NETWORK` command.
The `CPNETSTS` command is useful for displaying the current status.
Here is a sample session from CP/M 2.2:

```

If you are using CpSocketServer to provide the CP/NOS server, then
you will see some messages on your server console when clients
connect.  Here are the messages issued by the server in the above
example:

```
Connection from 192.168.1.201 (31100)
Remote 192.168.1.201 is f0
Creating HostFileBdos 00 device with root dir /home/wayne/cpnet/root
```

At this point CP/NET is ready for general use.  You should be able
to access files on the network mapped drives just like files on your
local drives.

## Network Boot

It is possible to boot your MT011 equipped RomWBW system directly from a
network server.  This means that the operating system will be loaded 
directly from the network server and all of your drive letters will be 
provided by the network server.  Duodyne is not yet supported in this 
mode of operation.

It is important to understand that the operating system that is loaded
in this case is **not** a RomWBW enhanced operating system.  Some
commands (such as the `ASSIGN` command) will not be possible.  Also,
you will only have access to drives provided by the network server --
no local disk drives will be available.

In order to do this, your MT011 Module **must** be enhanced with an 
NVRAM SPI FRAM mini-board.  The NVRAM is used to store your WizNet 
configuration values so they do not need to be re-entered every time you
power-cycle your system.

Using the same values from the previous example, you would
issue the `WIZCFG` commands:

```
wizcfg n F0
wizcfg i 192.168.1.201
wizcfg g 192.168.1.1
wizcfg s 255.255.255.0
wizcfg 0 00 192.168.1.3 31100
```

Note that the 'w' parameter is now omitted which causes these values to
be written to NVRAM.

As before, your network server will need to be running 
CpnetSocketServer. However, you will need to setup a directory that 
contains some files that will be sent to your RomWBW system when the 
Network boot is performed.  By default the directory will be
`~/NetBoot`.  In this directory you need to place the following files:

* `cpnos-wbw.sys`
* `ndos.spr`
* `snios.spr`

All of these files are found in the Binary/CPNET/NetBoot directory of 
the RomWBW distribution.

You also need to make sure CpnetSocketServer is configured with an 'A' 
drive and that drive must contain (at an absolute minimum) the following
file:

* `ccp.spr`

which is also found in the Binary/CPNET/NetBoot directory of RomWBW

Finally, you need to add the following line to your CpnetSocketServer 
configuration file:

`netboot_default = cpnos-wbw.sys`

To perform the network boot, you start your RomWBW system normally which
should leave you at the Boot Loader prompt.  The 'N' command will
initiate the network boot.  Here is an example of what this looks like:

```
RCBus [RCZ180_nat_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]: n

Loading Network Boot...

```

The CP/M operating system and the CP/NET components have been loaded 
directly from the network server.  All of your drive letters are 
automatically mapped directly to the drive letters configured with 
CpnetSocketServer.

  Drive O: = Drive O: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive P: = Drive P: on Network Server ID = 00H

List Device = LOCAL
```

At this point you can use CP/M and CP/NET normally, but all disk
access will be to/from the network drives.  There is no access to
your local disk drives in this boot mode.

# Transferring Files

Transferring files between your modern computer and your RomWBW
system can be achieved in a variety of ways. The most common of these
are described below. All of these have a certain degree of complexity
and I encourage new users to use the available community forums to
seek assistance as needed.

## Serial Port Transfers

RomWBW provides an serial file transfer program called XModem that
has been adapted to run under RomWBW hardware. The program is called
`XM` and is on your ROM disk as well as all of the pre-built disk
images.

You can type `XM` by itself to get usage information. In general, you
will run `XM` with parameters to indicate you want to send or receive
a file on your RomWBW system. Then, you will use your modern
computers terminal program to complete the process.

The `XM` application generally tries to detect the hardware you are
using and adapt to it. However, you must ensure that you have a
reliable serial connection. You must also ensure that the speed of
the connection is not too fast for XModem to service.  If your
file transfer attempts are failing, try either of the following:

- Check that hardware flow control is enabled in your terminal
  emulation software.
- Reduce the speed of your serial port connection.

There is an odd interaction between XModem and partner terminal
programs that can occur. Essentially, after launching `XM`, you must
start the protocol on your modern computer fairly quickly (usually in
about 20 seconds or so). So, if you do not pick a file on your modern
computer quickly enough, you will find that the transfer completes
about 16K, then hangs. The interaction that causes this is beyond the
scope of this document.

## Disk Image Transfers

It is possible to pass disk images between your RomWBW system and
your modern computer. This assumes you have an appropriate media slot
on your modern computer for the media you want to use (CF Card, SD
Card, floppy drive, etc.).

The general process to get files from your modern computer to a RomWBW
computer is:

1. Use `cpmtools` on your modern computer to create a RomWBW CP/M
filesystem image.

2. Insert your RomWBW media (CF Card, SD Card, floppy disk, etc.) in
your modern computer.

3. Use a disk imaging tool to copy the RomWBW filesystem image onto the
media.

4. Move the media back to the RomWBW computer.

This process is a little complicated, but it has the benefit of
allowing you to get a lot of files over to your RomWBW system quickly
and with little chance of corruption.

The process can be run in reverse to get files from your RomWBW
computer to a modern computer.

The exact use of these tools is a bit too much for this document, but
the tools are all included in the RomWBW distribution along with
usage documents.

Note that the build scripts for RomWBW create the default disk images
supplied with RomWBW. It is relatively easy to customize the contents
of the disk images that are part of RomWBW. This is described in more
detail in the Source/Images directory of the distribution.

## FAT Filesystem Transfers

The ability to interact with FAT filesystems was covered in
[FAT Filesystem].  This capability means that you can generally use your
 modern computer to make an SD Card, CF Card, or USB Drive with a 
standard FAT32 filesystem on it, then place that media in your RomWBW 
computer and access the files.

When formatting the media on your modern computer, be sure to pick the 
FAT filesystem. NTFS and other filesystems will not work.  As previously
mentioned, the `FAT` application does not understand long filenames, 
only the traditional 8.3 filenames.  If you have files on your modern 
computer with long filenames, it is usually easiest to rename them on 
the modern computer.

To copy files from your modern computer to your RomWBW computer, start 
by putting the disk media with the FAT filesystem in your modern 
computer.  The modern computer should recognize it. Then copy the files 
you want to get to your RomWBW computer onto this media.  Once done, 
remove the media from your modern computer and insert it in the RomWBW 
computer.  Finally, use the `FAT` tool to copy the files onto a CP/M 
drive.

This process works just fine in reverse if you want to copy files from a
CP/M filesystem to your modern computer.

**WARNING**: If you are using media that contains both a FAT partition 
and a RomWBW partition, your modern computer may be confused by the 
RomWBW partition.  In some cases, it will prompt you to format the 
RomWBW partition because it doesn't know what it is. You will be 
prompted before it does this -- just be careful not to allow it.

# Customizing RomWBW

## Startup Command Processing

Most of the operating systems supported by RomWBW provide a mechanism to
run commands at boot. This is similar to the AUTOEXEC.BAT files from
MS-DOS.

With the exception of ZPM3 and p-System, all operating systems will look
for a file called `PROFILE.SUB` on the system drive at boot. If it is
found, it will be processed as a standard CP/M submit file. You can read
about the use of the SUBMIT facility in the CP/M manuals included in
the RomWBW distribution. Note that the boot disk must also have a copy
of `SUBMIT.EXE`.

Note that the automatic startup processing generally requires booting
to a disk drive. Since the ROM disk is not writable, there is no
simple way to add/edit a `PROFILE.SUB` file there. If you want to
customize your ROM and add a `PROFILE.SUB` file to the ROM Disk, it
will work, but is a lot harder than using a boot disk.

In the case of ZPM3, the file called `STARTZPM.COM` will be run at
boot. To customize this file, you use the ZCPR ALIAS facility. You
will need to refer to ZCPR documentation for more information on the
ALIAS facility.

p-System has its own startup command processing mechanism that is
covered in the p-System documentation.

## ROM Customization

The pre-built ROM images are configured for the basic capabilities of
each platform. Additionally, some of the typical add-on hardware for
each platform will be automatically detected and used. If you want to
go beyond this, RomWBW provides a very flexible configuration
mechanism based on configuration files. Creating a customized ROM
requires running a build script, but it is quite easy to do.

Essentially, the creation of a custom ROM is accomplished by updating
a small configuration file, then running a script to compile the
software and generate the custom ROM and disk images. There are build
scripts for Windows, Linux, and MacOS to accommodate virtually all
users. All required build tools (compilers, assemblers, etc.) are
included in the distribution, so it is not necessary to setup a build
environment on your computer.

RomWBW can be built on modern Windows, Linux, or MacOS computers.  The 
process for building a custom ROM is documented in the ReadMe.txt file 
in the Source directory of the distribution.  Any modern version of 
Windows (32-bit or 64-bit), MacOS, or Linux released in the last 10 
years should be able to run the build process.

For those who are interested in more than basic system customization,
note that all source code is provided (including the operating
systems). Modification of the source code is considered an expert
level task and is left to the reader to pursue.

Note that the ROM customization process does not apply to UNA. All
UNA customization is performed within the ROM setup script that is
built into the ROM.

# UNA Hardware BIOS

John Coffman has produced a new generation of hardware BIOS called
UNA. The standard RomWBW distribution includes its own hardware
BIOS. However, RomWBW can alternatively be constructed with UNA as
the hardware BIOS portion of the ROM. If you wish to use the UNA
variant of RomWBW, then just program your ROM with the ROM image
called "UNA_std.rom" in the Binary directory. This one image is
suitable on **all** of the platforms and hardware UNA supports.

UNA is customized dynamically using a ROM based setup routine and the
setup is persisted in the system NVRAM of the RTC chip. This means
that the single UNA-based ROM image can be used on most of the
RetroBrew platforms and is easily customized. UNA also supports FAT
file system access that can be used for in-situ ROM programming and
loading system images.

While John is likely to enhance UNA over time, there are currently a
few things that UNA does not support:

* Floppy Drives
* Terminal Emulation
* Zeta 1, N8, RCBus, Easy Z80, and Dyno Systems
* Some older support boards

The UNA version embedded in RomWBW is the latest production release
of UNA. RomWBW will be updated with John's upcoming UNA release with
support for VGA3 as soon as it reaches production status.

Please refer to the
[UNA BIOS Firmware Page](https://www.retrobrewcomputers.org/doku.php?id=software:firmwareos:una:start)
for more information on UNA.

## UNA Usage Notes

- At startup, UNA will display a prompt similar to this:

  `Boot UNA unit number or ROM? [R,X,0..3] (R):`

  You generally want to choose 'R' which will then launch the RomWBW
  loader.  Attempting to boot from a disk using a number at the UNA
  prompt will only work for the legacy (hd512) disk format.  However,
  if you go to the RomWBW loader, you will be able to perform a disk
  boot on either disk format.

- The disk images created and distributed with RomWBW do not have the
  correct system track code for UNA.  In order to boot to disk under
  UNA, you must first use SYSCOPY to update the system track of the
  target disk.  The UNA ROM disk has the correct system track files
  for UNA: `CPM.SYS` and `ZSYS.SYS`.  So, you can boot a ROM OS and
  then use one of these files to update the system track.

- Only Z-System and CP/M 2 are available OSes under UNA at this time.
  Since NZ-COM launches from CP/M 2, it is usable.  p-System is not
  usable under UNA.

- Some of the RomWBW-specific applications are not UNA compatible.

# Upgrading

Upgrading to a newer release of RomWBW is essentially just a matter of
updating the ROM chip in your system. If you have spare ROM chips for
your system and a ROM programmer, it is always safest to retain your
existing, working ROM chip and program a new one with the new
firmware. If the new one fails to boot, you can easily return to the
known working ROM.

For each ROM that comes with the RomWBW distribution, you will find
that there are actually 3 different variants:

- `.rom` contains the complete ROM chip image
- `.upd` contains the system code, but omits the ROM Disk contents
- `.com` contains a CP/M executable version of the ROM code

So, for example, RCZ80_std contains the following files:

- `SBC_std.rom`
- `SBC_std.upd`
- `SBC_std.com`

The use of the `.com` variant is described below in [Application Boot].

As previously discussed, the ROM in most RomWBW systems contains both
the system code as well as a ROM Disk with files on it.  The `.rom`
variant of the ROM contains a full ROM chip image including both the
system code and the Rom Disk contents.  The `.upd` variant of the ROM
contains only the system code portion of the ROM.  If you apply the
`.upd` variant to your system, it will overlay the system code, but
will not overlay the ROM Disk contents (they remain intact).  You may
use either the `.rom` or the `.upd` file when updating your ROM chip
(this does not apply to Application Boot).  It is best to use the
`.rom` file for your upgrade because the files on your ROM Disk should
be updated whenever you update your system code.  The advantage of the
`.upd` variant is that is much smaller, so you can upload and apply it
faster.  The ROM update instructions below generally refer to using
the `.rom` variant.  However, you may substitute the `.upd` variant
if desired.

## Application Boot

Prior to attempting to reprogram your actual ROM chip, you may wish to
"try" the update to ensure it will work on your system. With RomWBW, you
can upload a new ROM image executable and load it from the command
line. For each ROM image file (.rom) in the Binary directory, you will
find a corresponding application file (.com). For example, for
SBC_std.rom, there is also an SBC_std.com file.

You can upload the `.com` file to your system using XModem, then simply 
run the `.com` file. You will see your system go through the normal 
startup process just like it was started from ROM. However, your 
physical ROM has not been updated and the next time you boot your 
system, it will revert to the system image contained in ROM.

Using this `.com` version of a ROM is an excellent way to confirm that
the new ROM code you intend to program will work correctly.  If it
does not, then you can just reboot and your old ROM will be loaded.

When the `.com` file is loaded, you will be taken to the normal
Boot Loader menu.  However, you will find that the only OS that is
available to boot from ROM is ZSDOS.  There is only room for a
single OS in the .com file.  Even if you don't normally use ZSDOS,
this will still confirm that your system operates well under the
new ROM code.

## Upgrading via Flash Utility

If you do not have easy access to a ROM programmer, it is usually
possible to reprogram your system ROM using the FLASH utility from
Will Sowerbutts. This application, called FLASH.COM, can be found on the
ROM drive of any running system. In this case, you would need to
transfer the new ROM image (.rom) over to your system using XModem (or
one of the other mechanisms described in the [Transferring Files]
section). The ROM image is too large to fit on your RAM drive,
so you will need to transfer it to a larger storage drive. Once the
ROM image is on your system, you can use the FLASH application to
update your ROM. The following is a typical example of transferring
ROM image using XModem and flashing the chip in-situ.

**NOTE**: The FLASH utility **can not** determine the type of your
ROM chip if it is write protected.  Additionally, it has no way to
determine if it is write protected.  If the FLASH utility
indicates it does not recognize your ROM chip, check to ensure the
chip is not write protected.

```

```

Obviously, there is some risk to this approach since any issues with the
programming or ROM image could result in a non-functional system.

To confirm your ROM chip has been successfully updated, restart your
system and boot an operating system from ROM. Do not boot from a disk
device yet. Review the boot messages to see if any issues have
occurred.

## Upgrading via XModem Flash Updater

Similar to using the Flash utility, the system ROM can be updated
or upgraded through the ROM-based updater utility. This works by
reprogramming the flash ROM as the file is being transferred.

Using the ROM-based updater has the advantage that secondary storage is 
not required to hold the new image.  In other words, it is not
necessary to have a mass storage device available to store the
ROM image.

From the Boot Loader menu select X (Xmodem Flash Updater) and then
U (Begin Update). Then initiate the Xmodem transfer of the `.rom` file.
Since the XModem Flash Updater will be relatively slow, you may wish
to use the `.upd` varient of the ROM.

More information can be found in the ROM Applications document.

## Post Upgrade System Image and Application Update Process

Once you are satisfied that the ROM is working well, you will need to
update the system images and RomWBW custom applications on your disk
drives. The system images and custom applications are matched to the
RomWBW ROM firmware in use. If you attempt to boot a disk or run
applications that have not been updated to match the current ROM
firmware, you are likely to have odd problems.

The simplest way to update your disk media is to just use your modern
computer to overwrite the entire media with the latest disk image of
your choice. This process is described below in the [Disk Images]
section. If you wish to update existing disk media in your system, you
need to perform the following steps.

If the disk is bootable, you need to update the system image on the
disk using the procedure described in the [Operating Systems] section
of this document.

Finally, if you have copies of any of the RomWBW custom applications
on your hard disk, you need to update them with the latest copies. The
following applications are found on your ROM disk. Use COPY to copy
them over any older versions of the app on your disk:

* ASSIGN.COM
* SYSCOPY.COM
* MODE.COM
* FDU.COM
* FORMAT.COM
* XM.COM
* FLASH.COM
* FDISK80.COM
* TALK.COM
* RTC.COM
* TIMER.COM
* FAT.COM

For example: `B>COPY ASSIGN.COM C:`

Some RomWBW custom applications are too large to fit on the ROM disk.
If you are using any of these you will need to transfer them to your
system and then update all copies. These applications are found in
the Binary/Apps directory of the distribution and in all of the disk
images.

* TUNE.COM

The files normally contained on the standard ROM Disk is based on a 512K
ROM.  If your system has a smaller size ROM, then not all of these 
files will be included on your ROM Disk.  You will need to copy them to
your system from the /Binary/Apps folder of the RomWBW distribution.

**WARNING**: If you run a RomWBW-specific application that is not
the appropriate for the version of RomWBW you are running, the
application will generate an error message and abort.

## System Update

As previously described, a RomWBW ROM contains ROM applications as well 
as a ROM disk image.  If you are upgrading your ROM with a new patch 
level release, you may wish to upgrade just the application portion of 
the ROM.  This is referred to as a System Update.

If the system running ROMWBW utilizes the SST39SF040 Flash chip then it 
is possible to do a System Update in place of a System Upgrade in some 
cases.  A System Update would involve only updating the BIOS, ROM 
applications and ROM-hosted operating systems.

A System Update may be more favorable than a System Upgrade in cases
such as:

 - Overwriting of the ROM drive contents is not desired.
 - Temporary disk space is unavailable to hold a full ROM image.
 - To reduce the time taken to transfer and flash a full ROM.
 - Configuration changes are only minor and do not impact disk
   applications.

The RomWBW build process generates a system update file along with
the normal ROM image and can be identified by the extension ".upd". It
will be 128Kb in size. In comparison the normal ROM image will have
the extension ".rom" and be 512Kb or 1024Kb in size.

Transferring and flashing the System Update is accomplished in the same 
manner as described above in [Upgrading via Flash Utility] with the 
required difference being that the flash application needs to be 
directed to complete a partial flash using the /P command line switch.

`E>FLASH WRITE ROM.UPD /P`

  AY-3-8910 sound driver, DMA support, and a long list of general code
  and documentation enhancements.

* Ed Brindley contributed some of the code that supports the RCBus
  platform.

* Spencer Owen created the RC2014 series of hobbyist kit computers
  which has exponentially increased RomWBW usage.  Some of his kits
  include RomWBW.

* Stephen Cousins has likewise created a series of hobbyist kit
  computers at Small Computer Central and is distributing RomWBW
  with many of them.

* Alan Cox has contributed some driver code and has provided a great
  deal of advice.

* The CP/NET client files were developed by Douglas Miller.

* Phillip Stevens contributed support for FreeRTOS.

* Curt Mayer contributed the original Linux / MacOS build process.

* UNA BIOS and FDISK80 are the products of John Coffman.

* Tasty Basic is a product of Dimitri Theulings.

* Dean Netherton contributed the sound driver interface and
  the SN76489 sound driver.

* The RomWBW Disk Catalog document was produced by Mykl Orders.

* Rob Prouse has created many of the supplemental disk images
  including Aztec C, HiTech C, SLR Z80ASM, Turbo Pascal, Microsoft
  BASIC Compiler, Microsoft Fortran Compiler, and a Games
  compendium.

* Martin R has provided substantial help reviewing and improving the
  User Guide.

* Jacques Pelletier has contributed the DS1501 RTC driver code.

* Jose Collado has contributed enhancements to the TMS driver
  including compatibility with standard TMS register configuration.

* Kevin Boone has contributed a generic HBIOS date/time utility (WDATE).

* Matt Carroll has contributed a fix to XM.COM that corrects the
  port specification when doing a send.

* Dean Jenkins enhanced the build process to accommodate the
  Raspberry Pi 4.

* Tom Plano has contributed a new utility (HTALK) to allow talking
  directly to HBIOS COM ports.

* Lars Nelson has contributed several generic utilities such as
  a universal (OS agnostic) UNARC application.

* Dylan Hall added support for specifying a secondary console.

* Bill Shen has contributed boot loaders for several of his
  systems.

# Appendixes

`\clearpage`{=latex}

## Appendix A - Pre-built ROM Images

This appendix contains a summary of the system configuration target
for each of the pre-built ROM images included in the RomWBW
distribution.  It is intended to help you select the correct ROM
image and understand the basic hardware components supported.
Detailed hardware system configuration information should be obtained
from your system provider/designer.  I am happy to provide support
adapting RomWBW to new or modified systems -- see [Getting Assistance]
for contact information.

The standard ROM images will detect and install support for certain
devices and peripherals that are on-board or frequently used with
each platform as documented below.  If the device or peripheral is
not detected at boot, the ROM will simply bypass support
appropriately.

By default, RomWBW will use the first available character device it
discovers for the initial console.  Serial devices are scanned in
the following order:

#. ASCI: Zilog Z180 CPU Built-in Serial Ports
#. Z2U: Zilog Z280 CPU Built-in Serial Ports
#. UART: 16C550 Family Serial Interface
#. DUART: SCC2681 or compatible Dual UART
#. SIO: Zilog Serial Port Interface
#. ACIA: MC68B50 Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter

In some cases, support for multiple hardware components with potentially
conflicting resource usage are handled by a single ROM image.  It is up
to the user to ensure that no conflicting hardware is in use.

The RomWBW `TUNE` application will detect an AY-3-8910/YM2149
Sound Module regardless of whether support for it is included in
the RomWBW HBIOS configuration.

                    ZPM3 by Simeon Cran.
                    ====================
ZPM3 is a Z80 coded BDOS replacement for banked CP/M 3.0 systems.

This is release 0010 on 1/2/93.

Since version 0009 the .SPR files have been updated. They are 
slightly faster and will possibly work on the Bondwell or other 
machines that they seemed to fail on before. ZPM3LDR.REL has also 
been modified. The main improvements throughout should be in 
speed. The differences may not be obvious, but you should upgrade 
to this latest version. SJC.

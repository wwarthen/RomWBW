RESBDOS3.SPR and BNKBDOS3.SPR have been replaced
with versions from the Jon Saxton disassembly with
fixes distribution.  The file called zpm3fix.txt
have been included and details the fixes.

ZPMLDR has also been updated with the version from
the Jon Saxton disassembly.  However, it has additionally
been updated to correct an issue that was preventing
RomWBW from booting under ZPMLDR.

ZPMLDR has a slightly modified version of the rdSeq
procedure (compared to CPMLDR).  It appears that this
causes deblocking to be bypassed on the initial disk
read of CPM3.SYS.  As a result, the entire disk sector
(512 bytes) is read starting at 0x0080.  This winds up
overlaying 0x180 bytes of the start of ZPMLDR.COM causing
it to fail catastrophically.

According to the documentation at the top of zpm3ldr.z80,
zpmldr is normally loaded from system tracks to address
0x0400.  In that scenario, the read of the entire sector
would not overlay the start of the application.  So, I
suspect this is why this (bug?) is not relevant to many
implementations.

The ZPM3LDR.REL file used here has been modified to
sync the rdSeq procedure back to the DIR CPMLDR version.
This seems to allow ZPMLDR to work with RomWBW now.

PATCHES TO SIMEON CRAN'S ZPM3
=============================

ZPM3 is a CP/M 3 workalike written by Simeon Cran.  It is readily available in
binary form; just look for archives like zpm3n10.arc and similar.

This patch contains updated BNKBDOS3.SPR and RESBDOS3.SPR files although it
is only the banked portion which has been modified.

Three changes have been implemented.

1. BDOS function 152 (Parse file name) password bug
===================================================

The first change was to fix a bug identified by Tilmann Reh in the file name
parser invoked by BDOS function 152.  Unlike the parser in standard CP/M 3,
Simeon's version can deal with a user number.  The FCB which is filled in by
the parser has the following structure where the field names are those shown
in the CP/M 3 Programmer's Reference Manual:


  Offset   Field   Length
  ------   -----   ------
     0       DR       1     Drive code (0 = current, 1 = A, ... 16 = P
     1      NAME      8     File name
     9      TYPE      3     File type (extension)
    12       PM       1     Password mode
    13       S1       1     Reserved
    14       S2       1     Reserved
    15       RC       1     Reserved (Result code)
    16    PASSWORD    8     Password (encrypted)
    24    RESERVED    8     Used by CP/M 3

Now the RC field gets set to FFh if an error occurs during the parse but S1
and S2 are not used at all by CP/M 3.  Simeon's parser uses those fields to
store the user number (S1) and a copy of the DR field (S2) thus rendering the
parser far more useful in that it can now handle names like

	K12:TESSER.CAT

and deliver a sensible result to a user program.

None of this is useful to other CP/M 3 implementations and so most programs do
their own parsing but the basic idea is commendable.  However Tilmann noticed
that if a password is attached to a file then Simeon's parser puts it in the
wrong place, overwriting the four fields PM through RC.

It is probably not a critical issue; after all, how many CP/M 3 users bother
to password-protect files?  Nevertheless it is clearly wrong and is fixed in
this version of BNKBDOS3.SPR.

2. BDOS function 152 (Parse file name) user/drive prefix
========================================================

A limitation of Simeon's parser is that it cannot handle the UD: (user, drive)
prefix, only the DU: form.  That was annoying to me since I am just as likely
to type 7g:tesser.cat as g7:tesser.cat.  My second patch was to fix ZPM3 to
handle both the UD: and DU: prefix forms.

I also put the drive number in the S2 field even when no drive was specified
in the input string.  Assuming that the current drive is E and the current
user number is 8 then the following results are obtained with the inputs
shown:

	Input string		DR    S1    S2
	------------		--    --    --
	FILE.EXT		 0     8     5
	E:FILE.EXT		 5     8     5     
	12:FILE.EXT		 0    12     5
	G:FILE.EXT		 7     8     7
	G12:FILE.EXT		 7    12     7
	12G:FILE.EXT		 7    12     7

The interesting cases shown above are the first and third.  Setting DR to zero
is consistent with the way standard CP/M works and the setting of S2 is just
extra information which may be of use to the calling program but which can
be ignored.  Unfortunately it is not possible to do the same thing with the
user number because standard CP/M does not have a field for that.

3. BDOS function 152 (Parse file name) Clear target FCB
=======================================================

On 2013-09-05 a contributor to comp.os.cpm known only as "Ed" pointed out that
there is yet another bug in BDOS 152 in that it does not clear the record
number fields in the last four bytes of the FCB populated by the function.
A program which uses the FCB for a read or write operation without first
explicitly setting the fields will have the I/O operation start at some
unexpected position in the file.

This problem has also been fixed.

4. Command line editing keys
============================

A couple of years ago I added code to yaze-ag (a Z80 emulator) to make it
possible to use the cursor and function keys on a modern PC keyboard to do
sensible things in CP/M.  The keyboard translations are specified in external
text files and can be loaded dynamically from within CP/M.

By far the most useful translate table maps the arrow keys to WordStar
controls.  For example, pressing the up arrow key generates a ^E, pressing
PgUp generates ^R and so on.  This works really well in most cases but there
is one piece of software which gives problems, namely CP/M itself.

Yaze-ag uses Simeon Cran's ZPM3 as a replacement for the CP/M 3 BDOS.  It was
a good choice because ZPM3 offers more features than standard CP/M 3 and in
particular, it provides a rich command history facility with decent recall and
edit capabilities.

As originally implemented, ZPM3 viewed the history as an upward-growing
stack, i.e. with new lines being added at the top.  For example assume
that lines comprising the single words "one", "two", "three", "four" and
"five" are entered in sequence.  The history looks like this:

	->			(current line, blank)
		five		(newest)
		four
		three
		two
		one		(oldest)

According to this view, the NEXT line in the history is the last one
entered.  After ^W ^W ^W ^W (NEXT, NEXT, NEXT, NEXT) the view is like this:

		two		(line ready for editing)
		five		(newest)
		four
		three
	->	two
		one		(oldest)

After ^E ^E (PREVIOUS, PREVIOUS) the view is:

		four		(line ready for editing)
		five		(newest)
	->	four
		three
		two
		one		(oldest)

This is all very consistent.  The problem is that it is utterly counter-
intuitive and the complete reverse of any recall and edit scheme in any
other operating system.  For example, linux and Windows both view shell
command history as a stack, but one which grows downwards.  The most
recently entered command is the one conceptually ABOVE the current line.
This view of the command history also corresponds to the way that we
compose text, where new lines are added below the most recently added
lines.

Using the same five-line example as above, the initial view would be:

		one		(oldest)
		two
		three
		four
		five		(newest)
	->			(current line, blank)

After UP, UP, UP, UP the view is:

		one		(oldest)
	->	two
		three
		four
		five		(newest)
		two		(line ready for editing)

then DOWN, DOWN yields:

		one		(oldest)
		two
		three
	->	four
		five		(newest)
		four		(line ready for editing)

Tilman Reh recognised this as a bug when he disassembled this ZPM3.
It was fixed by cross-renaming the two routines NextLine and PreviousLine
and for WordStar compatability the NextLine routine was moved to ^W.
That meant the previous occupant of the ^W position, DeleteToLeft had to
be moved also.  For no particularly good reason I chose to use the just-
vacated ^X slot.

Although I cannot imagine why one would want to do so, the original ZPM3
behaviour can be recovered by setting the assembly-time switch "HistoryBug"
to some odd number, e.g. 0FFFFh.

BPBIOS for RomWBW / HBIOS
-------------------------

The build process included in this directory constructs multiple BPBIOS OS images that
can be loaded dynamically on a running RomWBW CP/M-like system.	 Normally, you would
boot CP/M and then load the desired variant.  On a running system, you would enter
something like "LDSYS BP34T".  This document describes the specifics of the build
process and the image variations which are identified by naming convention.

Each image is composed of three basic components: Command Processor (CCP), Disk
Operating System (DOS), and Basic I/O System (BIOS).  The CCP and DOS components
are pre-built, relocatable binaries.  The BIOS (BPBIOS) is assembled into a relocatable
binary by the build, then the build links together all three components to form the
final loadable image (.IMG) file.  The linking process is performed by the custom BPBIOS
linker (BPBUILD.COM).  In addition to linking the 3 components, BPBUILD also sets
adjusts the ZCPR environment configuration.

BPBUILD is designed to be run interactively.  However, it can be started with an
existing OS image to edit an existing image file.  In order to achieve an automated
build process with no interaction, this directory contains several template image (.DAT)
files that have environment configurations defined below. The build process passes the desired
tempate file to BPBUILD on the command line and uses input redirection to automate the
running of BPBUILD.

The CCP can be ZCPR 3.3 (ZCPR33?.REL), ZCPR 3.4 (Z34.REL), or ZCPR 4.1 (Z41.ZRL).  ZCPR 3.3
uses static references to the ZCPR segments, so a custom version of it must be assembled.
The ZCPR33 subdirectory provides a build process for doing this.  It produces a specific
version for each of the memory segment configurations (ZCPR33T.REL & ZCPR33N.REL).

The DOS can be ZSDOS 1.1 (ZSDOS.ZRL) or ZSDOS 2.03 (ZS203.ZRL).	 These are both pre-built
relocatable binaries.  Note that only certain version combinations of ZSDOS and ZCPR are
possible as indicated below.  Additionally, ZSDOS 2.X requires a banked BIOS.

ZCPR 3.X == ZSDOS 1.X
ZCPR 4.X == ZSDOS 2.X

BPBIOS must be assembled for the target configuration.	BPBIOS includes a DEF-WW-???????.LIB
file during assembly which sets various equates to contol the features and behavior of
BPBIOS.	 The most critical ones are:

  BANKED: If YES, BPBIOS implements memory banking features
  ZSDOS2: If YES, BPBIOS is built to utilize ZSDOS 2.X specifics features
  INTPXY: If YES, BPBIOS implements HBIOS proxy code internally w/ stub at FFE0H-FFFFH

The table below illustrates the target build configurations along with the
.DAT and .LIB files which are utilized for the specific configuration.	The "?"
is replaced with a letter that represents one of the ZCPR memory segment configurations
described later in this document.

BP33?.DAT	DEF-WW-Z33?.LIB		Non-Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 3.3 & ZSDOS 1.1
BP33?BNK.DAT	DEF-WW-Z33?BNK.LIB	Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 3.3 & ZSDOS 1.1
BP34?.DAT	DEF-WW-Z34?.LIB		Non-Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 3.4 & ZSDOS 1.1
BP34?BNK.DAT	DEF-WW-Z34?BNK.LIB	Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 3.4 & ZSDOS 1.1
BP41?BNK.DAT	DEF-WW-Z41?BNK.LIB	Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 4.1 & ZSDOS 2.03

The table below illustrates the BPBIOS equates used and the specific CCP/DOS/BIOS
components that are used to generate each configuration.  As above, the "?" is
replaced with a letter that represents one of the ZCPR memory segment configurations
described later in this document.

BIOS		BP33.REL	BP33BNK.REL	BP34.REL	BP34BNK.REL	BP41.REL
--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------

In addition to the configuration options above, ZCPR also utilizes a
defined set of memory segments in upper memory.	 The location and size of these
segments have many ramifications and general ZCPR / BPBIOS documents
should be consulted to understand these.  The build process used here
produces several different configurations which can be loaded at runtime.
The original distributed memory segment configuration occupies the top
of memory which, unfortunately, conflicts with the RomWBW HBIOS need to
occupy this space.

Although RomWBW HBIOS is implemented in it's own dedicated memory bank, it
requires a small proxy at the top of memory which acts as a mechansim to
route calls to HBIOS.  There are two ways to implement this upper memory
proxy.	The full proxy occupies FE00H-FFFFH and implements all of the
HBIOS routing code.  Alternatively, a mini proxy can be utilized to
minimize the dedicated proxy space in upper memory.  The mini proxy
requires just 20H bytes at the top of memory (FFE0H-FFFFH), but requires
that the bulk of the proxy code be implemented internally in BPBIOS.

Taking the above into account, the build process implements a couple of
memory segment configurations that are compatible with RomWBW HBIOS.
Essentially, these configurations rearrange the ZCPR memory segments
to free up the area required by the HBIOS full or mini proxy.  Note
that this is a bit complicated because there are some constraints on
the locations of certain segments.

First, the RCP, FCP, and IOP segments contain executable code which is
pre-built and intended to run at specific locations.  Specifically, the
SYS.RCP, SYS.FCP, and SYS.IOP files provided with the BPBIOS distribution
must be loaded at their original intended location.  In theory, new
versions of these files could be created to load at different locations,
but that is not the approach taken here.  Instead, the memory segment
configurations are designed to keep these 3 components at the same
location as the original distribution.

BPBIOS is assembled as relocatable code.  Subsequently, the BPBUILD tool
is used to link BPBIOS with the CCP and DOS relocatable code to produce
the absolute image (.IMG file).  Note that BPBUILD does more than just
linking.  As part of it's work, BPBUILD adjusts the built-in environment
segment to customize the final image for the desired location and size
of Z-System segments.

The following table summarizes the original memory segment configuration and the
two new configurations utilized by this build process.	As indicated above, the
original configuration is incompatible with RomWBW HBIOS because it occupies the
very top of memory.  This configuration is shown below purely to document the
original distribued configuration.

The sections below provide a more detailed description of the memory
segment configurations.

=============================================================================
ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION CONFIGURATION (NO HBIOS):
  This is the original distribution configuration of BPBIOS which
  occupies all upper RAM (to FFFFH).  So, there is no room for the
  HBIOS proxy and, therefore, is not compatibile with RomWBW.  This
  configuration is documented only for reference.  It is not built
  by the build process and is not compatible with RomWBW HBIOS.

=============================================================================

=============================================================================
T CONFIGURATION (HBIOS FULL PROXY @ FC00-FFFF):
  This configuration uses a modified layout of the ZSystem segments so
  that critical segments can be located at the same address as the
  "stock" configuration.  Some segments are built with an assumed
  memory location and will generally fail if they are not loaded in
  that location.  The Flow Control Package (FCP) and Resident
  Command Processor (RCP) are very sensitive to this.  This configuration
  places them at their original locations, so they work well.

=============================================================================

=============================================================================
N CONFIGURATION (HBIOS MINI PROXY @ FFE0-FFFF):
  This configuration frees up the top 20H bytes of memory to make space for the
  HBIOS mini-proxy.  It does this by shrinking Cmd Line and shifting the Ext Stack
  down by 32 bytes.  This configuration will only work if INTPXY=YES in HBIOS.

BPBIOS is designed to invoke a command at startup (autostart command).  There
are 3 ZEX command files customized for this build.  They are Z33.ZEX, Z34.ZEX,
and Z41.ZEX.  BPBIOS is customized to launch the ZEX command file corresponding
to the version of ZCPR being linked with it.

The table below summarizes the loadable image files created by the build
process:

ZCPR	ZSDOS	BPBIOS		STARTUP		T (INTPXY=NO)	N (INTPXY=YES)
------	------	--------------  --------------	--------------	--------------		
v3.3	v1.1	NON-BANKED      Z33.ZEX		BP33T.IMG	BP33N.IMG		
v3.3	v1.1	BANKED          Z33.ZEX		BP33TBNK.IMG	BP33NBNK.IMG		
v3.4	v1.1	NON-BANKED      Z34.ZEX		BP34T.IMG	BP34N.IMG		
v3.4	v1.1	BANKED          Z34.ZEX		BP34TBNK.IMG	BP34NBNK.IMG		
v4.1	v2.03	BANKED          Z41.ZEX		BP41TBNK.IMG	BP41NBNK.IMG

WARNING: Once an N configuration image has been loaded, it is no longer
possible to load a T configuration without rebooting.  This constraint
exists because the N configurations wipe out all but the top 20H bytes
of memory.  The T configurations rely on the full 200H byte HBIOS
proxy.

BPBIOS for RomWBW / HBIOS
-------------------------

The build process included in this directory constructs multiple BPBIOS OS images that
can be loaded dynamically on a running RomWBW CP/M-like system.	 Normally, you would
boot CP/M and then load the desired variant.  On a running system, you would enter
something like "LDSYS BP34".  This document describes the specifics of the build
process and the image variations which are identified by naming convention.

Each image is composed of three basic components: Command Processor (CCP), Disk
Operating System (DOS), and Basic I/O System (BIOS).  The CCP and DOS components
are pre-built, relocatable binaries.  The BIOS (BPBIOS) is assembled into a relocatable
binary by the build, then the build links together all three components to form the
final loadable image (.IMG) file.  The linking process is performed by the custom BPBIOS
linker (BPBUILD.COM).  In addition to linking the 3 components, BPBUILD also sets
adjusts the ZCPR environment configuration.

BPBUILD is designed to be run interactively.  However, it can be started with an
existing OS image to edit an existing image file.  In order to achieve an automated
build process with no interaction, this directory contains several template image (.DAT)
files that have environment configurations defined below. The build process passes the desired
tempate file to BPBUILD on the command line and uses input redirection to automate the
running of BPBUILD.

The CCP can be ZCPR 3.3 (ZCPR33?.REL), ZCPR 3.4 (Z34.REL), or ZCPR 4.1 (Z41.ZRL).  ZCPR 3.3
uses static references to the ZCPR segments, so a custom version of it must be assembled.
The ZCPR33 subdirectory provides a build process for doing this.  It produces a specific
version for each of the memory segment configurations (ZCPR33T.REL & ZCPR33N.REL).

The DOS can be ZSDOS 1.1 (ZSDOS.ZRL) or ZSDOS 2.03 (ZS203.ZRL).	 These are both pre-built
relocatable binaries.  Note that only certain version combinations of ZSDOS and ZCPR are
possible as indicated below.  Additionally, ZSDOS 2.X requires a banked BIOS.

ZCPR 3.X == ZSDOS 1.X
ZCPR 4.X == ZSDOS 2.X

BPBIOS must be assembled for the target configuration.	BPBIOS includes a DEF-WW-???????.LIB
file during assembly which sets various equates to contol the features and behavior of
BPBIOS.	 The relevant settings are:

  BANKED: If YES, BPBIOS implements memory banking features
  ZSDOS2: If YES, BPBIOS is built to utilize ZSDOS 2.X specifics features

The table below illustrates the target build configurations along with the
.DAT and .LIB files which are utilized for the specific configuration.	The "?"
is replaced with a letter that represents one of the ZCPR memory segment configurations
described later in this document.

BP33.DAT	DEF-WW-Z33.LIB		Non-Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 3.3 & ZSDOS 1.1
BP33BNK.DAT	DEF-WW-Z33BNK.LIB	Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 3.3 & ZSDOS 1.1
BP34.DAT	DEF-WW-Z34.LIB		Non-Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 3.4 & ZSDOS 1.1
BP34BNK.DAT	DEF-WW-Z34BNK.LIB	Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 3.4 & ZSDOS 1.1
BP41BNK.DAT	DEF-WW-Z41BNK.LIB	Banked BPBIOS w/ ZCPR 4.1 & ZSDOS 2.X

The table below illustrates the BPBIOS equates used and the specific CCP/DOS/BIOS
components that are used to generate each configuration.  As above, the "?" is
replaced with a letter that represents one of the ZCPR memory segment configurations
described later in this document.

		BP33		BP33BNK		BP34		BP34BNK		BP41BNK
--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------
BANKED		NO		YES		NO		YES		YES
ZSDOS2		NO		NO		NO		NO		YES
--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------	--------------

In addition to the configuration options above, ZCPR also utilizes a 
defined set of memory segments in upper memory.	 The location and 
size of these segments have many ramifications and general ZCPR / 
BPBIOS documents should be consulted to understand these.  The build 
process used here produces a custom configuration appropriate for 
RomWBW. The original distributed memory segment configuration occupies 
the top of memory which, unfortunately, conflicts with the RomWBW 
HBIOS need to occupy this space.

Although RomWBW HBIOS is implemented in it's own dedicated memory 
bank, it requires a small proxy at the top of memory which acts as a 
mechansim to route calls to HBIOS.  The proxy occupies FE00H-FFFFH and 
implements all of the HBIOS routing code.

Taking the above into account, the build process implements a memory 
segment configuration that is compatible with RomWBW HBIOS. 
Essentially, this configuration rearranges the ZCPR memory segments to 
free up the area required by the HBIOS proxy.  Note that this is a bit 
complicated because there are some constraints on the locations of 
certain segments.

BPBIOS is assembled as relocatable code.  Subsequently, the BPBUILD tool
is used to link BPBIOS with the CCP and DOS relocatable code to produce
the loadable image (.IMG file).  Note that BPBUILD does more than just
linking.  As part of it's work, BPBUILD adjusts the built-in environment
segment to customize the final image for the desired location and size
of Z-System segments.

The following table summarizes the original memory segment configuration and the
new configuration utilized by this build process.  As indicated above, the
original configuration is incompatible with RomWBW HBIOS because it occupies the
very top of memory.  The original configuration is shown below purely to
document the original distributed configuration.

The sections below provide a more detailed description of the memory
segment configurations.

=============================================================================
ORIGINAL DISTRIBUTION CONFIGURATION (NO HBIOS):
  This is the original distribution configuration of BPBIOS which
  occupies all upper RAM (to FFFFH).  So, there is no room for the
  HBIOS proxy and, therefore, is not compatibile with RomWBW.  This
  configuration is documented only for reference.  It is not built
  by the build process and is not compatible with RomWBW HBIOS.

BPBIOS is designed to invoke a command at startup (autostart command).  There
are 3 ZEX command files customized for this build.  They are ZSTT.ZEX, ZSTN.ZEX,
and ZSTF.ZEX.  BPBIOS is customized to launch the ZEX command file corresponding
to the version of ZCPR being linked with it.

The table below summarizes the loadable image files created by the build
process:

;------------ Banked User Area Control Information ---------------
; An existing User Area cannot exist in Bank 0 by decree.  The User Area
; can therefore be used as a flag to determine whether such an area exists.
; The Bank Number is set in DEF-xx.LIB.  To keep Page 0 equivalent free in
; the user bank, we offset values to 80H (it's just a good number).  The
; top of each User Bank is 7FFFH as with all of the switched banks in
; a B/P Bios System.  Banked applications should chain themselves together
; sequentially so that the end can be determined and space managed.

;-------- Physical Floppy Disk Configuration Information ---------
; The Physical Drive table consists of 5 bytes for each of 4 Floppy Drives
; thereby providing all necessary data to all types of controllers.
;
;  1 - Drive Characteristics Bits.  The Bits have the following meanings:
;     D D D D D D D D
;     7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
;     | | | | | +-+-+---- Disk Size 000=Fixed; 001=8"; 010=5.25"; 011=3.5" (*)
;     | | | | +---------- Single-Sided (0); Double-Sided (1)
;     | | | +------------ (Reserved for Double-Step(1) in XDPH)
;     | | +-------------- Drive Motor Control (1); Motor Always On (0)
;     | +---------------- Max Speed is 5.25" (0); 8" & Hard Disk & Hi-Dens (1)
;     +------------------ (Reserved for Single(1)/Double(0) Density in XDPH)
;    (*) - 3.5" and 5.25" drives are treated the same for many formats with
;		the drive bits being reduced to 010B in the BIOS code.
;  2 - Drive Step Rate (1 to 16 in increments of 1) in milliseconds
;  3 - Head Load Time (2 to 254 in increments of 2) in milliseconds
;  4 - Head Unload Time (16 to 240 in increments of 16) in milliseconds
;  5 - Number of Physical Tracks on Drive

;-------- Physical Hard Drive Configuration Information ----------
; Hard Disk data begins w/Controller Type, followed by data for 3 drives.
; The first byte for each drive consists of a byte containing bit codes
; for SCSI Device, Logical Unit, and a bit indicating whether or not the
; drive is physically connected to the system.  The configuration should
; match that contained in DPHHD-xx.LIB for Hard Drive partitions.
;	   Bit	7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
;		| | | | | | | |
;		| | | | | +-+-+-- Physical Device Number (0..6, 7 = Host)
;		| | | | +-------- (reserved)
;		| | | +---------- 1 = Drive Active, 0 = No Drive
;		+-+-+------------ Logical Unit Number (usually 0 or 1)

;.....
; The Controller Type Byte contains information needed to dictate the specific
; bytes to be used to communicate to a SASI/SCSI-connected Hard Drive.
; Additional bytes will be defined as needed, so please coordinate any
; extensions with the Authors to insure the generality of tools.

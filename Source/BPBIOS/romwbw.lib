;
; NOTE: Must make sure settings below match hardware and
;       HBIOS configuration.
;
HBIOS	EQU	YES			; Use HBIOS functions
HBLOC	EQU	0FE00H			; Location of HBIOS proxy
MEMTOP	EQU	HBLOC - 1		; Last usable address
;
HB_DEBUG	EQU	FALSE		; See hbios.z80 file
;
; Set HB_IODEV to desired HBIOS character device unit number
;
; TODO: Query system via HBIOS API to determine number of serial
; devices available and assign up to 3 of them to the 3 serial
; device slots in BPBIOS at boot.
;
HB_IODEV	EQU	80H		; 0x80 is current HBIOS console
;
; Set HB_MDRAM/ROM to desired HBIOS disk device numbers
;
HB_MDRAM	EQU	0		; HBIOS Disk Unit #0 is usually the RAM Disk
HB_MDROM	EQU	1		; HBIOS Disk Unit #1 is usually the ROM Disk
;
; Set HB_HDDEVN to appropriate HBIOS disk device numbers
;
; If the RomWBW system has no floppy drives, then the hard disk units
; will start right after the memory disk units.  So, the first hard disk
; will be unit #2.  Refer to the DPH entries to see how the HBIOS
; units are mapped to drive letters.
;
HB_HDDEV0	EQU	2		; If no floppy drives in system, first HBIOS hard disk is unit #2
HB_HDDEV1	EQU	3		; Second hard disk is HBIOS Disk Device #3
HB_HDDEV2	EQU	4		; Third hard disk is HBIOS Disk Device #4
;
; Floppy disk support
;
; TODO: Query HBIOS to see if system has floppy drive(s).  For now
; we do not really support floppy drives.
;
DRV_O		SET	NO		; YES if system has flopy drives
DRV_P		SET	NO		; YES if system has flopy drives
;
; RAM/ROM Bank Reserve
;
HB_RAMRESV	EQU	8		; RAM reserve is 8 banks
HB_ROMRESV	EQU	4		; ROM reserve is 4 banks
;
; Layout of RAM banks
;
; TODO: Query system via HBIOS API to determine the actual bank
; assignments, then adjust BPBIOS operation accordingly.

# This PowerShell script is used to prepare the build environment for
# HBIOS.  It starts by validating and/or prompting the user for several
# key variables that control the build: Platform, Config, ROM size, and
# optionally an override for the output ROM name.  These variables are
# then placed in a generated batch command file allowing them to be
# exposed to the subsequent build steps.  Next, it generates a
# small TASM include file that exposes some variables to the subsequent
# assembly process.
#
# The RomWBW build is heavily dependent on the concept of a hardware "platform" and the associated
# "configuration".  The build process selects a pair of files that are included in the HBIOS assembly
# to create the hardware-specific ROM image.  First, a platform file called cfg_<platform>.asm is
# included to establish the required assembly equates for the main hardware platform.  Second, a
# file from the Config subdirectory is included to tune the build for the specific setup of the
# desired hardware platform.  The platform file establishes all of the default equate values for
# the platform being built.  The config file is used to override the values in the platform file
# as desired.
#
# Note that there is a special platform called UNA.  UNA is John Coffman's hardware BIOS which is an
# alternative to HBIOS.  UNA is a single image that will run on all platforms and has a built-in
# setup mechanism so that multiple configuration are not needed.  When building for UNA, the pre-built
# UNA BIOS is simply imbedded, it is not built here.

ZMD150.LBR - CP/M Communications
   09/29/88 - This release is super clean, super fast - and smaller.
   Some major problems in the way Ymodem Batch protocol was implemented
   on CP/M systems has been fixed, virtually eliminating all delays
   between files.  CPM3 systems can now run all ZMD programs with no
   problems.  Some other bug fixes, modifications and enhancements.
   This is probably the last release of ZMD until ZMD with ZMODEM is
   released.    Bob Kramer - RI RCPM-RDOS (128 Mb) - (309) 786-6711

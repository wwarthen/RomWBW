VGM Player for Z80
==================

Simple player for VGM (Video Game Music) files.

Usage:

  VGMPLAY MUSIC.VGM

Default Ports:

  D8H-D0H - First AY-3-8910 (RSEL/RDAT)
  A0H-A1H - Second AY-3-8910
  FFH     - First SN76489
  FBH     - Second SN76489
  C6H-C7H - YM2612/YM3484

If your system uses different ports you need to recompile the source.

Note: The player should be compatible with VGM files up to version 1.51
but there are very few controls (if any) in the code, be sure to have
a good VGM file that doesn't contain much extra data. These files can be
very big, the player is limited to the available TPA space which is
typically around 54-55k, bigger files will overwrite the CP/M code and/or
wrap around the 64k limit. 

The played is designed to run on a standard RC2014 with a 7.3728 MHz clock, 
if your system uses a different clock you need to adjust the frame delay accordingly.

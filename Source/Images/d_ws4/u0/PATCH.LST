		;The function key table allows you to program any function keys that
		;your terminal supports into one or more other keystrokes.  Note that
		;on many terminals, the function keys generate a sequence of characters
		;where the first character is a control code.  Since WordStar probably
		;uses this same code for one its commands, a timer is used to determine
		;when the "burst" of characters from the function key is done.
		;This works because the terminal will usually send the function
		;key characters at close to full baud rate.  At 9600 baud, each character
		;takes 1/960 of a second to send, or close to one millisecond.  That
		;means that three characters would take approximately three milliseconds.
		;There is no way that even the fastest human typist could type that
		;fast!  Therefore, this method will usually work.
		;
		;Each function key in the table below is represented by two strings.
		;The first describes the "burst" from the key.  The second is what it
		;should be translated into.  You may not use string indirections in
		;this table (size of -1 followed by address).
		;
		;The end of the function key table is indicated when the size of the
		;function key string is zero.  If you have more function keys than will
		;fit, you can put a continuation address after the zero to point to more
		;table.  The table at that address must be the same format as this
		;one.  No continuation is indicated by an address of zero.
		;
		;One character "bursts" will not work here.  If you need to translate
		;a single character into something else, use the user console input
		;routine UCONI.
		;
		;Warning!  Terminals or computers that have their own type-ahead
		;buffering may cause problems with this approach since it will be more
		;likely that characters other than just function keys will be "burst"
		;into WordStar by it.

		;		TERMINAL PATCH AREA
		;
		;This section contains the user-modifiable constants and
		;	routines for hardware-dependent terminal functions
		;	and characteristics required by the editor.
		;
		;There are three types of patches in this area.  One can
		;	patch data values (HITE, WID) which describe the
		;	terminal, strings (CLEAD1, ERAEOL) which define
		;	control sequences, or actual microprocessor
		;	instructions.
		;
		;For the string sequences, the first byte of the patch
		;	indicates the number of bytes in the string,
		;	followed by that many string bytes.  If there is
		;	insufficient room for the whole string, the format
		;	can be modified by putting a -1 (0FFH) where the
		;	number of bytes would go, and then putting the
		;	address in the following two bytes (low order byte
		;	first) of the address where the longer patch
		;	resides.  The longer patch must then be of the
		;	normal format which is the number of bytes followed
		;	by the string.
		;
		;This area is normally patched for your specific terminal
		;	by the interactive INSTALL program.  Additional
		;	patching to this area is needed only for unusual
		;	terminals or video boards, or to meet special
		;	requirements, or to enhance or personalize your
		;	copy of WordStar.  The default user area is
		;	set up for this example installation.

		;
		;For terminals that do not fit the above patterns, you

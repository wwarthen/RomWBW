1.  How to Use ZDKCOM.

     ZDKCOM compiles an ASCII text file into a *.ZDK file of key 
macros which ZDENSTAL will install in ZDE.  It alsos convert an 
existing ZDK file into a text file with the extension ZDT.  It 
allows you to create, edit, and re-edit complicated key macros 
with a full-featured word processor - ZDE itself - instead of the 
backspace-only line editor in ZDENSTAL.  The syntax is:

 ZDKCOM <ufn>.ZDT
   converts text file to ZDK overlay

 ZDKCOM <ufn>.ZDK
   converts overlay to ZDT text file  

     Use ZDE in NONDOCUMENT mode to type a file that looks like 
what you see when you use the K option of ZDENSTAL, substituting 
lower case "n" or "q" for the No Repeat and Quiet option 
indicators <N> and <Q>:

  qThis line would be for key 0 in Quiet mode.^M
  nThis line would be for key 1 in No Repeat mode.^M

  This line would be key 3, with key 2 unassigned.
  n<This line would appear in angle brackets.>^M^M^M
  The line above, key 4, prints with two blank lines following it.
  q"This is in quotes, but no carriage return at the end."
  "This line is ^P^BMacro Key 7^P^B with embedded boldface codes."^M
  q^VThis line turns insert on before printing the line.^A^A^A^A_^F^D_^M
  n <Key 9 not installed>^A^A^A^A

...and so on.  Lines correspond to the number keys in 0 to 9 
order, with blank lines for unassigned keys.  Do NOT embed control 
codes.  Type everything in ASCII.  For instance, to underline, 
type out '^P^Swords underlined^P^S'.  It's a good idea to make 
hard carriage returns visible by toggling them on with the ^OD 
command.  ZDKCOM accepts trailing spaces as part of the macro, 
even though you can't see them, so, if you don't want them, make 
sure each line is terminated by a hard carriage return.
     Individual key macro strings may not exceed 127 bytes in the 
ZDK file, though they may in the ZDT text file, since ASCII 
representations of single-byte control codes require two bytes, 
and option flags and slashes don't contribute to the length of the 
string.
     The total of all strings may not exceed 498 output bytes.  
This is two bytes less than allowed by ZDE and ZDENSTAL, but, 
under the program's present logic, it would require an inordinate 
amount of code to make those last two bytes available.  If you 
really need them, add them to the ZDK file with ZPATCH or any 
other patcher, locate the last string-length byte, and add 2 (in 
hex) to it.
     For a quick demo, remove the leading spaces from the lines 
below, mark them as a block, and write them out to <ufn>.ZDT.  Run 
ZDKCOM <ufn>.ZDT.  Then load the resulting ZDK file into ZDE with 
the command ZDENSTAL ZDE <ufn>.ZDK.

  q^[b^[0^Qs^X^[=^M1^[= 1^S^V ^D^[!0^[1^Qb^B^Ku

Key macro 0 measures off one full page if the top margin is 0 and 
the page length is 58 lines.  Adjust for different page lengths by 
adding or subtracting ^E's.  I use this macro to move from line 1 
of a page to line 1 of the next page.  I then use key macro 9 to 
read in a page header from a separate file that contains nothing 
but the properly spaced header text with a # in place of the page 
number.  I search for # with a ^Qf and replace it with the 
appropriate page numbers.
     This happens so quickly on a 9 mhz SB180 with hard disk that 
it is virtually unnoticeable, but there is a faster way to do it.  
Just make up a header at the top of the first page, or, if you 
want to start page headers only on page two, at the foot of the 
file, and mark it as a block.  Use key macro 0 to move from the 
top line of a page to the top line of the next, and copy the 
header into place with the ^KC command.  Don't forget to erase the 
original of the header at the foot of the file when you get there.
     Key macro 1 softens and reforms a paragraph by removing the 
hard carriage returns from the ends of each line.
     Key macro 2 changes a document in flush left block format 
(like this one) to indented paragraph form, and key macro 3 
changes it back again.
     Key macro 4 embeds my DIABLO 1610-compatible printer's code 
for setting a left margin in column 11 (^K=0Bh) in the document.  
If I want another margin I add or subtract from 0Bh and overwrite 
the ^K with the appropriate control character.  You may well be 
able to substitute your own printer's set left margin code for 
this one.
     Key macro 5 reads in a previously prepared letterhead stored 
as LH.FMT on drive/user A0.
     Key macro 6 removes four spaces or characters from the 
beginning of each line, used to remove line numbers from the 
beginnings of messages in modem capture files.


2.  Programmer's Note.

     A ZDK file is a data structure four records long.  The first 
two bytes are an ID number which ZDENSTAL checks to ensure that it 
is working with the correct version.  The current number, 0250h, 
is valid for several recent versions of ZDE.
     These two bytes are followed by up to ten strings, each 
preceded by a string-length byte which ZDE uses to index the 
string's location.  Each string is limited by the size of a buffer 
in ZDE to 127 bytes.
     An empty string is indicated by a string-length byte of 00h.  
After the last byte of the last string, the remainder of the 512 
bytes are filled with 00h.
     It is a peculiarity of ZDKCOM that it needs to write two null 
bytes at the end of the file, which means that it will accept only 
498 bytes for the total length of all strings (512, less two ID 
bytes, less 10 string-length bytes, less these two more) rather 
than the 500 that ZDE and ZDENSTAL allow.
     When you look at the key macro buffer of ZDE using the K 
option of ZDENSTAL, you see something that looks like this:

  <0><Q>This line would be for key 0 in Quiet mode.^M
  <1><N>This line would be for key 1 in No Repeat mode.^M
  <2><>
  <3>This line would be key 3, with key 2 unassigned.
  <4><N><This line would appear in angle brackets.>^M^M^M
  <5>The line above, key 4, prints with two blank lines following it.
  <6><Q>"This is in quotes, but no carriage return at the end."
  <7>"This line is ^P^BMacro Key 7^P^B with embedded boldface codes."^M
  <8><>
  <9><>

The numbers down the side and the option indicators <N>, <Q>, and 
<> (no option) are supplied by ZDENSTAL.  The ZDT text file 
version of the same macro keys would omit the string numbers and 
no option indicators, and convert the <N> and <Q> to simple lower 
case 'n' and 'q'.  If you need lower case 'n' or 'q' as the first 
character of a key macro, just precede it with a slash, which will 
be ignored.
     ZDKCOM recognizes blank lines as unassigned keys.  These 
produce an "error" message when invoked by ZDE.
     ZDE recognizes a No Repeat option if the the high bit is set 
on the first byte of the macro string after the length byte, and a 
Quiet option if the high bit is set on both of the first two bytes 
of the string.
     The translation procedure from text to overlay requires:

  Enter two-byte ID string 02h 50h in output file.

  Enter 00h to save a place for a string length byte.

  Check for "n" or "q" as first three bytes of new string and add 
  80h to the next byte or next two bytes input as required.

  Read in the rest of the string byte by byte and output each byte 
  to the output file.  If "^" appears in the string, drop it and 
  subtract 40h from next byte to make it into a real control 
  character.  If "/" appears, ignore it and print the next 
  character literally.  "/^" prints "^" rather than turn the 
  character following the carat into a control code, and "//" 
  prints a single slash.  A single input slash is ignored.

  When the CRLF pair is encountered in the input text file, 
  convert it to a 00h place marker for the length of the next 
  string.  Get the number of bytes output in the last string and 
  write it to the position of the string-length byte at the head 
  of the preceding string.

  When the text file's ^Z EOF is encountered, fill the remainder 
  of the total 512 bytes with 00h and close the files.

When converting ZDK overlays to ZDT text files, the procedure is 
more or less reversed.  ZDKCOM converts the string length bytes to 
CRLF pairs, the control code bytes to two-byte ASCII strings '^c', 
and finishes off the file when all strings are accounted for by 
inserting an EOF ^Z.
     In addition, ZDKCOM has error checking for file opening and 
closing and for individual and overall string length, and it 
reports activity to keep the user from thinking the program has 
hung, though the counters on the screen are otherwise meaningless.
     The structure of the four-sector ZDK file in CP/M is so 
similar to the eight-sector MS/DOS version that you can use 
ZDKCOM, along with a patcher, to create a VDK file for 
installation in VDE12, the MS/DOS version of ZDE.  Make up the ZDT 
file as you would for CP/M, then patch the second ID byte from 50h 
to 60h and add four records of nulls.

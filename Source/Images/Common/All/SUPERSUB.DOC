			SUPERSUB DOCUMENTATION	(revised 09/13/81)

SUPERSUB is intended as a replacement program for SUBMIT.COM provided
with CP/M by Digital Research Corporation.  This document assumes you
are familiar with that utility and its use.

			------------------

Version 1.1 update:

Control-character translation has been added.  This facility works
similarly to CP/M's SUBMIT, where a desired control character is gen-
erated in the text file by preceeding the character with a circumflex
character.  For example, control-V is generated from "^V".  Thanks to
Keith Petersen for pointing out this omission.

A bug in line number reporting when errors are encountered has been
repaired.  Line numbers reported should now correspond to the actual
line number in the file.

			------------------

 SUPERSUB provides the following new capabilities:

	1) Null input lines are properly interpreted; they cause
	   the creation of a zero-length line in $$$.SUB.

	2) SUBMIT jobs may be nested.

	3) For small SUBMIT jobs, the command lines may be specified
	   on the SUPERSUB command line, seperated by semicolons.

	4) An interactive mode allows command lines to be entered
	   directly into SUPERSUB without need of a text editor.

	5) A built-in help function is provided.

	6) The output drive and number of allowable parameters may
	   by specified at assembly time.

NESTING
-------

SUBMIT jobs may be nested under SUPERSUB. For example, suppose you
have a submit file to compile a program:

BASCOM =$1
L80 $1,$1/N/E
PIP B:=$1.COM
ERA $1.REL
ERA $1.COM

named COMPILE.SUB.  You may then submit a job to compile several
programs using COMPILE.SUB.  For example, you can create a file
called COMPALL.SUB consisting of:

SUPERSUB COMPILE MYPROG
SUPERSUB COMPILE RBBS.ASC
SUPERSUB COMPILE PRIMES.BAS.

This is especially useful when using INTERACTIVE or SUMMARY modes.
In combination with Ward Christensen's FMAP program (CPMUG), some
very powerful command structures may be built.

SUMMARY MODE
------------

Summary mode allows the entire SUBMIT job to be specified in the
CP/M command line.  This mode is enabled by using the slash ("/")
character as the first character of the command line. The indiv-
idual submit lines must be seperated with a semicolon. For example,

     A>SUPERSUB / CRCK *.* F;CRCK B:*.* F;COMPARE CRCKFILE.CRC B:				 ^
		 |
		  ----> (this space is optional)

will create a file of CRC's of all files on A:, then create a similar
file on B:, then compare the two.  (CRCK, by Keith Petersen, and
COMPARE, by Ward Christensen, are available from the CP/M Users Group).

INTERACTIVE MODE
----------------

You may enter the interactive entry mode by typing "SUPERSUB /<CR>"
(ie, "SUPERSUB /" with no arguments).  Supersub will prompt for input
with an asterisk, and you may then enter SUBMIT lines from the keyboard.
You may enter more than one logical line on a physical line using
semicolon seperation.  An empty line terminates the input.  Example:

A>SUPERSUB /
*CRCK *.* F
*CRCK B:*.* F
*COMPARE CRCKFILE.CRC B:
*				<empty line here>
A>CRCK *.* F			<submit file begins execution>

has the same effect as the above SUMMARY mode example.

HELP FUNCTION
-------------

Typing SUPERSUB with no arguments will print the built-in help file.





NOTES
-----

1) Nested SUBMIT runs are only usable up to a maximum of 128 nested
   commands at any one time.  This is a limitation of the CP/M Console
   Command Processor.

2) If you change the drive specification for the output file, you
   may want to do the same thing with XSUB (Digital Research's function
   nine extender).  Within XSUB, find the submit File Control Block
   (search for "$$$     SUB" within XSUB.COM)  and change the first FCB
   byte (ie, the byte before the first "$") to:
		0 - use default drive
		1 - use drive A:
		2 - use drive B:
   etc.

3) In SUMMARY and INTERACTIVE modes, passed parameters have no meaning.
   When these modes are used, the parameter flag, "$", will be passed
   through literally to the output file.

4) Zero-length output lines may be created in SUMMARY and INTERACTIVE
   modes by using two consecutive semicolons.  This is, in effect, a
   blank logical line.

5) Interactive mode may be aborted by typing control-C as the first
   character of a line.  Also, all normal CP/M editing characters are
   available.

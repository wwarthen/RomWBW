This file provides user-level documentation and operating instructions for
UNARC version 1.6, released March 27, 1987.  Refer to the notice at the end of
this file regarding rights of use and distribution of this program.

The release message file, UNARC.MSG, provides a list of all additional files
distributed with the current UNARC release and describes the program changes
from the previous version 1.4 and 1.5 releases.



ABSTRACT
--------

UNARC is a utility program for CP/M systems which allows the listing, typeout,
printing, checking, and extraction of subfiles contained in "archive" library
(*.ARC or *.ARK) files.  These are commonly used for compressed file storage
on remote access bulletin board systems.  UNARC provides the CP/M user the
ability to process such files after downloading them via modem from these
remote systems.



REQUIREMENTS
------------

UNARC requires CP/M version 2 or higher.  The program is offered in two
versions.  The standard version, UNARC.COM, requires a Z80 processor (or
compatible equivalent, e.g. HD64180 or NSC800).  An alternate version,
UNARCA.COM, is provided for systems with 8080 or 8085 processors (or 16-bit
systems using the NEC V20 for CP/M emulation).  Identical capabilities are
provided by the two program versions.

                                     NOTE

      Although UNARCA.COM can execute on ANY system capable of
      supporting CP/M, it is larger and significantly slower than
      UNARC.COM and should be avoided by users of Z80-based systems.

UNARC is written in Z80 assembly language and requires only 5K bytes of disk
storage (6K for UNARCA).  As distributed, the program requires at least 30K
bytes of available memory space (TPA) for full support of all archive file
formats (31K TPA size for UNARCA).  (Smaller systems may be able to use some
of the program's capabilities.)



ABOUT ARC/ARK FILES
-------------------

The files which UNARC processes utilize a format that was introduced by the
ARC shareware utility program, which executes on 16-bit computers running the
MS-DOS (or PC-DOS) operating system.  This format has achieved widespread
popularity since the ARC program first appeared in March 1985, and it has
become the de facto standard for file storage on remote access systems
catering to 16-bit computer users.  More recently this file format has
achieved increased popularity on RCP/M (Remote CP/M) systems.

                                     NOTE

      Most RCP/M system operators have adopted the convention of naming
      CP/M archive files with the filetype ARK.  This differentiates
      these from MS-DOS archive files, which use the filetype ARC.  This
      is a naming convention only:  There is no difference in format,
      and UNARC will accept files of either type interchangeably.

An archive is a group of files collected together into a single file in such a
way that the individual files may be recovered intact.  In this respect,
archives are similar in function to libraries (*.LBR files), which have been
commonplace on CP/M systems since 1982, when the original LU library utility
program was introduced by Gary P. Novosielski.  (However, the two file formats
are not compatible.)

The distinguishing characteristic of an ARC archive is that its component
files are automatically compressed when they are added to the archive, so that
the resulting file occupies a minimum amount of disk space.  Of course, file
compression techniques have also been commonplace in the CP/M world since
1981, when the public domain SQ and USQ "squeeze and unsqueeze" programs were
introduced by Richard Greenlaw.

The SQ/USQ programs and their numerous popular descendants utilize a well-
known general-purpose form of data compression (Huffman coding).  This
technique, which is also utilized in ARC files, performs well for many text
files but often produces poor compression of binary files (e.g. object program
.COM files).  The ARC program also provides an advanced data compression
method, which it terms "crunching."  This method (which is based on the
Lempel-Ziv-Welch or "LZW" algorithm) performs better than squeezing in most
cases, often achieving 50% or better compression of ASCII text files, 15-40%
compression of binary object files, and as much as 95% compression of bit-
mapped graphics image files.

Five different methods are actually employed for storing files in an archive.
The method chosen for a particular file is the one which results in the best
compression for that file:

(1)  No compression ("unpacked").  The file is stored in its original form.

(2)  Run-length encoding ("packed").  Repeated sequences of 3-255 identical
     bytes are compressed into a three-byte sequence.

(3)  Huffman coding ("squeezed").  Each 8-bit byte (after run-length encoding)
     is encoded by a variable number of bits, with bit length (approximately)
     inversely proportional to the frequency of occurence of the corresponding
     byte.

(4)  LZW compression ("crunched").  Variable-length strings of bytes (in
     theory, up to nearly 4000 bytes in length) are represented by a single
     (maximum) 12-bit code (after run-length encoding).

(5)  LZW compression ("squashed").  This is a variation of crunching which
     uses (maximum) 13-bit codes (and no run-length encoding).

Note that since one of the five methods involves no compression at all, the
resulting archive entry will never be larger than the original file.

                                     NOTE

      The most recent release of the MS-DOS ARC program (version 5.20)
      has eliminated squeezing as a compression technique.  However,
      UNARC continues to process squeezed files for compatibility with
      archives created by earlier versions of ARC and by other MS-DOS
      archiving programs (notably PKARC).

      The squashed compression method was recently introduced by the
      MS-DOS programs PKARC and PKXARC.  UNARC can process files which
      use this method, although it is not universally accepted by other
      MS-DOS archive extraction programs (including ARC).

During its lifetime, the ARC program has undergone numerous revisions which
have employed different variations on some of the above methods, particularly
LZW compression.  In order to retain compatibility with archives created by
earlier program revisions, ARC stores a "version" indicator with each file in
an archive.  Based on this indicator, the latest release of the ARC program
can always extract files created by older releases (although it will only use
the latest data compression versions when adding new files to an archive).

                                     NOTE

      The current release of UNARC supports archive file versions
      generated by all releases of the following MS-DOS programs through
      (at least) the indicated program versions:

         ARC  5.20 (24 Oct 86), by System Enhancement Associates, Inc.
         ARCA 1.22 (13 Sep 86), by Wayne Chin and Vernon Buerg
         ARCH 5.38 (26 Jun 86), by Les Satenstein
         PKARC 2.0 (15 Dec 86), by Phil Katz (PKWARE, Inc.)

      (UNARC does not recognize, but is unaffected by, the non-standard
      archive and file commenting feature of PKARC.)

Although the above discussion has emphasized the origin of archive files for
the MS-DOS operating system, their use has recently spread to many other
systems.  Programs compatible with MS-DOS ARC have appeared for UNIX, Atari
68000, VAX/VMS, and TOPS-20 systems.  A CP/M utility for building archive
files will also be available in the near future.

For additional information about archive files and the MS-DOS ARC utility,
refer to the documentation file, ARC.DOC, which is available from most remote
access systems which utilize archive files.  For additional information about
the LZW algorithm (and data compression methods in general), refer to the
article "A Technique for High-Performance Data Compression", by Terry A.
Welch, in IEEE Computer magazine, Vol. 17, No. 6, June 1984.



USING UNARC
-----------

The UNARC program provides an on-line help message, which is generated by
running the program with an empty command line:


  A>UNARC

  UNARC  1.6  27 Mar 87
  CP/M Archive File Extractor

  Usage:  UNARC [d:]arcfile[.typ] [d:][afn] [N|P|C]

  Examples:
  B>UNARC A:SAVE.ARK *.*  ; List all files in CP/M archive SAVE on drive A
  B>UNARC A:SAVE.ARC *.*  ; List all files in MS-DOS archive SAVE on drive A
  A>UNARC SAVE            ; Same as either of above
  A>UNARC SAVE *.* N      ; Same as above (no screen pauses)
  A>UNARC SAVE *.DOC      ; List just .DOC files
  A>UNARC SAVE READ.ME    ; Typeout the file READ.ME
  A>UNARC SAVE READ.ME N  ; Typeout the file READ.ME (no screen pauses)
  A>UNARC SAVE A:         ; Extract all files to drive A
  A>UNARC SAVE B:*.DOC    ; Extract .DOC files to drive B
  A>UNARC SAVE C:READ.ME  ; Extract file READ.ME to drive C
  A>UNARC SAVE PRN.DAT P  ; Print the file PRN.DAT (no formatting)
  A>UNARC SAVE *.* C      ; Check validity of all files in archive


As shown by this help display, the UNARC utility provides the following
capabilities:

(1)  Listing the directory of an archive
(2)  Extracting component files from an archive
(3)  Typing the contents of a component file at the console
(4)  Printing a component file directly on the CP/M list device
(5)  Checking the validity of an archive and its component files

The particular operation to be performed is determined by the form of the file
parameter(s) in the command line, as described separately in the sections
which follow.  The following characteristics apply to all operations:

The first command line parameter must specify the name of an archive file.  A
drive name and filetype are optional.  The filetype, if omitted, defaults to
"ARK" or, if no such file exists, the alternate (MS-DOS) default "ARC" is
assumed.

The standard CP/M terminal control characters, CTRL-S (to suspend console
output) and CTRL-C (to abort the program), may be used at any time.  CTRL-K
may also be used as an alternate for CTRL-C.  Printer output to the CP/M list
device may be obtained by typing CTRL-P at CCP command level before executing
UNARC.

In addition, by default UNARC will pause after every 23 lines of console
output.  At this time, the message "[more]" will appear at the bottom of the
console screen.  The listing may be resumed by typing any key (other than
CTRL-S, CTRL-C, or CTRL-K, which will function as described above).  If the
space bar is used, one more line of console output will be displayed (over-
writing the "[more]" message) and the program will again pause.  If any other
key is typed (e.g. RETURN), another 23 lines of output will be allowed to
scroll onto the screen before the next pause.  (LINE FEED may be used to
prevent overprinting of the "[more]" line, e.g. for hard-copy terminals.)

If continuous display is desired, this automatic pause feature may be disabled
by specifying "N" at the end of the command line.  The "N" must be the last
command line character, and it must be preceded by a space.  Also, there must
be two preceding file parameters on the command line.  E.g., note the
difference between the following commands:

      A>UNARC SAVE N          ; Typeout the file N. in archive SAVE
      A>UNARC SAVE *.* N      ; List all files in archive SAVE with no pauses

The N option may not be used in conjunction with the P (Print) or C (Check)
options.



LISTING AN ARCHIVE DIRECTORY
----------------------------

By default, UNARC produces a detailed console listing of the component files
in an archive.  (In fact, there is no way to suppress this listing; it is
generated during all UNARC operations.)  If only the archive file name appears
on the command line, UNARC will generate a complete directory of all component
files in the specified archive file.  Otherwise, the second command line
parameter may be used to select a particular file to be listed (or group of
files, if it contains the ambiguous file specification characters "*" or "?").
If no disk drive name is provided for the second parameter, and this parameter
specifies a group of files, the directory listing is the only output generated
by the program.

A sample directory listing is illustrated here:


A>UNARC CODES

Archive File = CODES.ARK

ABLE    .DOC    24320   24k  Crunched  8    11777  52%  30 Apr 86 10:50a  42C0
BRAVO   .COM    17152   17k  Squeezed  4    14750  14%   2 May 86  4:11p  8CBD
CHARLIE .TXT      234    1k   Packed   3       99  58%   2 May 86  4:11p  8927
        ====  =======  ====               =======  ===                    ====
Total      3    41706   42k                 26626  36%                    58A4


This listing is equivalent to the "verbose" listing of the MS-DOS ARC program
(with the addition of the "Disk" and "Ver" fields, which are unique to UNARC).
The listing requires a 78-column terminal width; there is currently no "short"
listing format.

"Name" is the file name which will be generated if the file is extracted by
UNARC on a CP/M system.  (This is not necessarily the same as the name
recorded in the archive file.  Although CP/M and MS-DOS file naming
conventions are identical, two conversions are made to guarantee file name
validity under CP/M:  Lower-case letters are converted to upper-case, and
non-printing characters are converted to dollar signs, "$".)  Archive entries
are usually maintained (and hence listed) in alphabetic name order.

"Length" is the uncompressed file length, i.e. the number of bytes the file
will occupy if extracted to disk, exclusive of any additional length imposed
by the CP/M file system.  Note that MS-DOS permits files of arbitrary lengths
(unlike CP/M which restricts all files to a multiple of 128 bytes).

"Disk" is the actual amount of disk space required to extract the file to a
CP/M disk, expressed as a multiple of 1K (1024) bytes.  Note that this number
is dependent on the disk data allocation block size.  (CP/M permits various
block sizes, ranging from 1K to 16K bytes.  Typical sizes are 1K for single-
density floppy disks, 2K for double-density floppies, and 4K for hard disks,
although these values are quite system-dependent.)  In the absence of an
explicit output drive name, UNARC uses the block size of the default
(currently "logged") disk drive (i.e. the drive which appears in the CCP
prompt).

"Method" is the compression method used, specified as "Unpacked", "Packed",
"Squeezed", "Crunched", "Squashed", or "Unknown!".  If the method "Unknown!"
appears, it most likely indicates (if not a faulty archive file) a newer
release of the MS-DOS ARC program that supports a new compression method (or a
new variation of an existing method).  In this case, a corresponding new
release of UNARC will be required to extract the file.

"Ver" further identifies the version of compression used.  Currently, UNARC
supports versions 1-9: unpacked files can have versions 1 or 2; packed files,
version 3; squeezed files, version 4; crunched files, versions 5-8; and
squashed files, version 9.  The highest version number associated with each
compression method is the one generated by the most recent release of the
MS-DOS ARC program.

"Stored" is the compressed file length, i.e. the number of bytes occupied by
the file in the archive.  (This does not include the overhead associated with
the directory information itself, which adds an additional 29 bytes to the
size of each component file.)

"Saved" is the percentage of the original file length which was saved by
compression; i.e., higher values indicate better compression.  (The MS-DOS ARC
documentation refers to this as the "stowage factor.")  The value shown on the
totals line applies to the archive as a whole, not including the directory
overhead.

"Date" and "Time" refer to the last file modification, as of the time it was
added to the archive.  (Date and time stamping is, of course, one of the nice
features of MS-DOS which is lacking in standard CP/M 2.2.)

"CRC" is an internal 16-bit cyclic redundancy check value which is computed
when a file is added to an archive (expressed in hexadecimal).  As a test of
file validity, UNARC re-computes this value when it extracts a file (see
below).  Note that this value is calculated by a different method than that
used by either of the two popular public domain programs, CRCK and CHEK.  (It
is however quite valid as a reliable error-detection mechanism.)  This value
is shown in the listing for completeness only.  The value shown on the totals
line is the 16-bit sum of all displayed CRC values.  This is useful as a
single "checksum" value for comparing entire archives.  (Since the CRC values
are computed before compression takes place, the total should be the same for
all archives created from the same set of input files, independent of any
particular variations in file order or compression methods.)

The "Total" line is displayed only if multiple files appear in the listing,
and it includes a count of the number of files listed.



EXTRACTING FILES FROM AN ARCHIVE
--------------------------------

If the second command line parameter contains a disk drive name, UNARC will
extract the selected file(s) from the archive to CP/M file(s) on the indicated
disk drive.  If only a drive name appears, all component files of the archive
will be extracted.  The following illustrates a sample archive directory
listing as generated during a file extraction operation:


A>UNARC CODES B:

Archive File = CODES.ARK
Output Drive = B:

The above listing also illustrates several warning messages which may occur
when extracting files from an archive.

The message "Replace existing output file (y/n)?" appears if a file of the
same name already exists on the output drive.  The user must answer "Y" (or
"y") to allow the extraction to proceed (in which case, the existing file is
unceremoniously deleted).  Any other response will cause UNARC to preserve the
existing file, bypass the extraction operation for the current file, and
(except for a CTRL-C response) skip to the next file to be extracted (if any).

The first two warning messages illustrated above are provided as a check on
the validity of the extracted file.  These indicate that either the cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) value computed by UNARC, or the resulting extracted
file length, does not match the corresponding value recorded in the archive
when the original file was added to it.  The final warning message occurs if
UNARC fails to detect the proper format for the start of a new subfile, but
can recover by skipping a certain number of bytes in the archive file.  (If
the recovery attempt fails, UNARC aborts with the message "Invalid archive
file format.")  The appearance of any of these messages most likely indicates
that the file data has been corrupted in some way (e.g. during modem
transmission from a remote system).

Note that if the original (i.e. MS-DOS) file length was not an exact multiple
of 128 bytes (as required by CP/M), UNARC will pad the final record of the
extracted file with hex "1A" (ASCII CTRL-Z) bytes.  This provides the correct
end-of-file termination for text files, according to CP/M conventions.

Also, the disk space shown in the archive directory listing will be correct
for the specified disk drive.  (In the above examples, drive A: has a 1K data
allocation block size while drive B: has a 2K block size, which accounts for
the differences in the two listings.)  In order to determine the exact disk
space requirements in advance of a file extraction operation, the user may
first "log into" the desired output drive (i.e. select it as the default
drive), and run UNARC to obtain a directory listing only.  (This is a
consideration only on systems with mixed disk drive types.)

A file extraction operation may be aborted at any time by entering CTRL-C from
the console.  In this case, any partial output file will remain on disk and
should be deleted manually following the program abort.  (Any existing file of
the same name will have already been deleted, however.)



TYPING OUT A FILE IN AN ARCHIVE
-------------------------------

A console typeout of the contents of a single component file in an archive may
be requested by specifying a non-ambiguous file name (and no disk drive name)
in the second command line parameter.  For example:


A>UNARC CODES ABLE.DOC

Archive File = CODES.ARK

Name           Length  Disk   Method  Ver  Stored Saved    Date    Time   CRC
============  =======  ====  ======== === ======= ===== ========= ======  ====
ABLE    .DOC    24320   24k  Crunched  8    11777  52%  30 Apr 86 10:50a  42C0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is file ABLE.DOC, contained within the archive CODES.ARK.  Typeout will
 proceed until the end of this file or may be aborted by CTRL-C.....


The specified file is assumed to contain valid ASCII text data.  In
particular, all bytes are masked to seven bits, and all ASCII control
characters are ignored except for HT (horizontal tab, which is expanded to
blanks with assumed tab stops at every eighth column), LF, VT or FF (line
feed, vertical tab or form feed, which generate a new typeout line), and SUB
(CTRL-Z, which by CP/M convention indicates end-of-file and terminates the
typeout).  Note that BS (backspace) and CR (carriage return) are ignored, so
that text will not be obscured within files which utilize these for over-
printing (i.e. when directed to a printer).

The following filetypes, which are usually associated with binary (non-text)
data, are specifically excluded from typeout operations:  COM, EXE, OBJ, OV?,
REL, ?RL, INT, SYS, BAD, LBR, ARC, ARK, ?Q?, and ?Z?.  If one of these types
is specified, only the directory information for the requested file is listed.

Note that CRC and file length checking are not performed during a typeout
operation, as they are during extraction to a disk file.



PRINTING A FILE IN AN ARCHIVE
-----------------------------

A single component file in an archive may be output directly to the printer
(CP/M list device) by specifying a trailing "P" on the command line.  The "P"
must be the last command line character, and it must be separated from the
second file parameter by a space.  (The file parameter must specify a non-
ambiguous file name and no disk drive name.)  For example:

      A>UNARC CODES CHARLIE.TXT P

The specified file is assumed to contain data suitable for printer output and
is passed directly to the printer without alteration or additional formatting.
This operation is particularly well-suited for output of binary graphics
images on dot-matrix printers, since these can be extemely large but tend to
compress quite well (e.g. to less than 5% of their original size).  Note that
the binary data filetypes which are excluded from typeout operations are also
excluded from printing operations.  Printing may be paused or aborted by use
of the console CTRL-S and CTRL-C characters.



CHECKING FILES IN AN ARCHIVE
----------------------------

UNARC may be directed to extract one or more component files from an archive,
without actually storing these as disk files, by specifying a trailing "C" on
the command line.  This operation performs file CRC and length checking, and
it is useful for verifying correct modem data transmission of an archive.  The
"C" must be the last command line character, and it must be separated from the
second file parameter by a space.  (The file parameter must not specify a disk
drive name, which indicates extraction to disk.)  To check an entire archive,
specify "*.*" for the second file parameter, for example:

      A>UNARC CODES *.* C



PROGRAM OPTIONS
---------------

UNARC provides several options which may be used to tailor the program for
specific non-universal requirements.  Many of these are intended for RCP/M
(Remote CP/M) system operators, to allow generation of a secure version of
UNARC which can be used by remote callers for purposes of archive directory
listing and/or file typeout only (but not file extraction).  Others are
provided for specialized non-standard CP/M systems and need not concern the
majority of users running CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3.0 (CP/M Plus), or ZCPR3/ZRDOS
systems.  Additional options provide user preference features (such as the
number of screen lines between console output pauses, or the list of filetypes
excluded from typeout operations).

All of these options are described in UNARCOVL.ASM, an assembly language
source file that can be edited and assembled to generate a HEX-format overlay
for easy patching of the UNARC.COM or UNARCA.COM program files.  Complete
details are provided for technically-oriented users in UNARCOVL.ASM.  However,
the default options in the distributed program files are suitable for the
majority of users with standard CP/M operating systems.



PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION
--------------------

The UNARC program, its documentation, and all related files are distributed in
archive file format (of course!).  The distribution file is named UNARCxx.ARK,
where "xx" is derived from the current version number (e.g. UNARC16.ARK for
version 1.6).  (This does not include the program source code, which is
distributed separately.)  This archive has the special characteristic that it
is "self-unpacking."  I.e., a separate copy of the UNARC.COM program file is
NOT required to extract the component files from this archive.

The procedure for extracting the distribution files is quite simple:  First,
copy or rename UNARCxx.ARK to a program file, UNARCxx.COM, on the current disk
drive.  (Note that the filename, UNARCxx, must NOT be changed.)  Then, run
this program with a single optional command line parameter specifying the disk
drive to which all distribution files will be extracted (defaults to current
drive).

For example, assuming UNARC16.ARK is on drive B: and the files are to be
extracted to drive C:, the following CP/M commands may be used:

  A>B:                             ; Set current drive for UNARC16.ARK
  B>REN UNARC16.COM=UNARC16.ARK    ; Rename it to UNARC16.COM
  B>UNARC16 C:                     ; Run it to extract all files to drive C:

Note that this self-unpacking capability is provided only by the distributed
archive file, and it will not work if that file is altered or reconstructed.



AUTHOR'S NOTE
-------------

I undertook writing the UNARC program to satisfy my curiosity about software
developments in the MS-DOS/PC-DOS world.  At the time I began work on UNARC,
the MS-DOS ARC program had been in existence for over a year and had achieved
widespread popularity and acceptance in the 16-bit community.   Unfortunately,
the lack of a compatible equivalent for CP/M systems rendered a large amount
of public domain software inaccessible to 8-bit users such as myself.  (Note
that 16-bit software can indeed be of interest to users of 8-bit systems, e.g.
Pascal and C language programs.)

Also, an increasing number of RCP/M systems now cater to both 8-bit and 16-bit
users.  Since the release of UNARC 1.0 (May 3, 1986), I have been encouraged
to see that the program has found a welcome home on many such systems.
Special thanks are due to Irv Hoff and Norman Beeler for providing archive
file support in the KMD20 and LUX52 series of programs, respectively.  With
the increasing popularity of .ARC files on many different computer systems, I
believe that continued such support of this compression format is both
desirable and inevitable for CP/M systems.  At the time of this writing I am
about to release NOAH, a companion program to UNARC which will allow CP/M
users to generate ARC-compatible files.

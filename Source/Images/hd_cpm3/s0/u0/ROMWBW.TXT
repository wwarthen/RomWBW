This is a generic CP/M 3 adaptation for RomWBW.

To start CP/M 3, first boot into CP/M 2.2 or ZSystem.  Then
switch to the drive that contains the CP/M 3 hard disk image
and run CPMLDR.  You will be prompted for the disk unit
of the CP/M 3 image.

With the following exceptions, the files in this directory
came from the CP/M 3 binary distribution on "The Unofficial
CP/M Web site" at http://www.cpm.z80.de/binary.html.

As documented in the "README.1ST" file, the included
files have been patched with all applicable DRI patches
per CPM3FIX.PAT.

In addition, the following have been added:

- INITDIR.COM was not included.  The copy included is the
  original DRI distribution, with both patches installed.

- ZSID6.COM is the original DRI ZSID distribution, but
  patched to use RST 6 instead of RST 7 to avoid conflicting
  with mode 1 interrupts.

Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have
found fortunes in treasure and gold, though it is rumored
that some who enter are never seen again.  Magic is said
to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes and hands.  Direct
me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn you that I
look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
have to enter "Northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from
"North".  (Should you get stuck, type "help" for some
general hints).

#2
A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
#3
A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you,
threw a little axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
#4
There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
#5
One sharp, nasty knife is thrown at you!
#6
None of them hit you!
#7
One of them gets you!
#8
A hollow voice says "Plugh".
#9
There is no way to go that direction.
#10
I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or
nearby objects.
#11
I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name
something in the general direction you want to go.
#12
I don't know how to apply that word here.
#13
I don't understand that!
#14
I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
#15
Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will
repeat the long description of your location.
#16
It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall
into a pit.
#17
If you prefer, simply type W rather than West.
#18
Are you trying to catch the bird?
#19
The bird is frightened right now and you cannot catch
it no matter what you try.  Perhaps you might try later.
#20
Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
#21
You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it,
or anything like that.  There is a way to get by, but you
don't have the necessary resources right now.
#22
Do you really want to quit now?
#23
You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
#24
You are already carrying it!
#25
You can't be serious!
#26
The bird was unafraid when you entered, but as you approach
it becomes disturbed and you cannot catch it.
#27
You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
#28
There is nothing here with a lock!
#29
You aren't carrying it!
#30
The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an
astounding flurry drives the snake away.
#31
You have no keys!
#32
It has no lock.
#33
I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
#34
It was already locked.
#35
The grate is now locked.
#36
The grate is now unlocked.
#37
It was already unlocked.
#38
You have no source of light.
#39
Your lamp is now on.
#40
Your lamp is now off.
#41
There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain,_
which is probably just as well.
#42
Nothing happens.
#43
Where?
#44
There is nothing here to attack.
#45
The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
#46
Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
#47
You killed a little dwarf.
#48
You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
#49
With what? Your bare hands?
#50
Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
#51
I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try
words like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west,
north, south, up or down.  I know about a few special
objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects
can be manipulated using some of the action words I know.
Usually you will need to give both the object and action
words (In either order), but sometimes I can infer the
object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs;
in particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which
causes me to give you a list of what you're carrying.  The
objects have side effects; for instance, the rod scares the
bird.  Usually people having trouble moving just need
to try a few more words.  Usually people trying unsuccessfully
to manipulate an object are attempting something beyond their
(or my!) capabilities and should try a completely different
tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long distances
with a single word.  For example, "building" usually gets you
to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost
in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and
that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering
the next from the south.
Good luck!
#52
It misses!
#53
It gets you!
#54
OK
#55
You can't unlock the keys.
#56
You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up
back in the main passage.
#57
I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream
can run on the surface for very long.  I would try the stream.
#58
I need more detailed instructions to do that.
#59
I can only tell you what you see as you move about and
manipulate things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
#60
I don't know that word.
#61
What?
#62
Are you trying to get into the cave?
#63
The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You
cannot enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.
I would recommend looking elsewhere for the keys.
#64
The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple,
with an occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite
a bit of undergrowth, largely birch and ash saplings plus
nondescript bushes of various sorts.  This time of year 
visibility is quite restricted by all the leaves, but travel
is quite easy if you detour around the spruce and berry
bushes.

#66
Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a
shovel progress is unlikely.
#67
Blasting requires dynamite.
#68
I'm as confused as you are.
#69
Mist is a white vapor, usually water.  Seen from time to time
in caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a
sign of a deep pit leading down to water.
#70
Your feet are now wet.
#71
I think I just lost my appetite.
#72
Thank you.  It was delicious!
#73
You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes
strongly of minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely
cold.
#74
The bottle of water is now empty.
#75
Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.
Anyway, nothing exciting happens.
#76
Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
#77
Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
#78
You can't pour that.
#79
Watch it!
#80
Which way?
#81
Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might
be able to help you out, but I've never really done this
before.  Do you want me to try to reincarnate you?
#82
All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
                    --- POOF !! ---
You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and
gasping, you emerge from the smoke and find...
#83
You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long
I can keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating
you again?
#84
Okay, now where did i put my orange smoke? ... > POOF! <
Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
#85
Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You
don't expect me to do a decent reincarnation without any
orange smoke, do you?
#86
Okay, If you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
#87
Reserved
#88

#89
Reserved
#90
Reserved
#91
Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you
got here.
#92
You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something
first.
#93
You can't go through a locked steel grate!
#94
I believe what you want is right here with you.
#95
You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
#96
I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead
of jumping.
#97
There is no way across the fissure.
#98
You're not carrying anything.
#99
You are currently holding the following:
#100
It's not hungry (It's merely pinin' for the Fjords).  Besides
You have no bird seed.
#101
The snake has now devoured your bird.
#102
There's nothing here it wants to eat (Except perhaps you).
#103
You fool, Dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made
him REALLY mad !!
#104
You have nothing in which to carry it.
#105
Your bottle is already full.
#106
There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
#107
Your bottle is now full of water.
#108
Your bottle is now full of oil.
#109
You can't fill that.
#110
Don't be ridiculous!
#111
The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
#112
The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks:
"Water?".
#113
The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
#114
The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
although it requires some effort.
#115
The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
#116
The Dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
#117
Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with
you.  You'd best take inventory and drop something.
#118
You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
#119
You can't fit this five foot oyster through that little passage!
#120
I advise you to put down the clam before opening it. >STRAIN!<
#121
I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.
>WRENCH!<
#122
You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
#123
You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
#124
A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.
Goodness, this must really be an oyster.  (I never was
very good at identifying bivalves.)  Whatever it is,
it has now snapped shut again.
#125
The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.
It promptly snaps shut again.
#126
You have crawled around in some little holes and found your
way blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the
main passage.
#127
There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind
you.
#128
Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!
"Har, har" he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and
hide it away with me chest deep in the maze!".  He snatches
your treasure and vanishes into the gloom.
#129
A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave says:
"Cave closing soon.  All adventurers exit immediately
through main office."
#130
A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
"This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."
#131
It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so
close to closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
#132
The sepulchral voice entones, "The cave is now closed."  As
the echoes fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a
small puff of orange smoke). . . . 
As your eyes refocus you look around and find...
#133
There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in
the far wall, burying the Dwarves in the rubble.  You march
through the hole and find yourself in the main office, where
a cheering band of friendly elves carry the conquering
adventurer off into the sunset.
#134
There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in
the far wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of
molten lava pours in through the hole, destroying
everything in its path, including you!!
#135
There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across
the walls of the room.
#136
The resulting ruckus has awakened the Dwarves.  There are now
several threatening little Dwarves in the room with you!
Most of them throw knives at you!  All of them get you!
#137
Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
#138
I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
#139
I don't know the word "stop".   Use "quit" if you want to
give up.
#140
You can't get there from here.
#141
You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
#142
If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To
suspend you adventure such that you can continue later
say "suspend" (or "pause" or "save").  To see how well
you're doing, say "score".  To get full credit for a
treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,
though you get partial credit just for locating it.
You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting,
though the former costs you more.  There are also points
based on how much (If any) of the cave you've managed to
explore;  in particular, there is a large bonus just for
getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of
the pack), and there are other ways to determine whether
you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.
If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep
exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you
haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting DOES
happen, it means you're getting a bonus and have an
opportunity to garner many more points in the master's
section.  I may occasionally offer hints in you seem to
be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in
advance how much it will affect your score to accept the
hints.  Finally, to save paper, you may specify "brief",
which tells me never to repeat the full description of a place
unless you explicitly ask me to.
#143
Do you indeed wish to quit now?
#144
There is nothing here with which to fill the vase.
#145
The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered
the vase.
#146
It is beyond your power to do that.
#147
I don't know how.
#148
It is too far up for you to reach.
#149
You killed a little Dwarf.  The body vanished in a cloud
of greasy black smoke.
#150
The shell is very strong and impervious to attack.
#151
What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start
over.
#152
The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
#153
The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
#154
The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an
astounding flurry gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
#155
On what?
#156
Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the
first time you come to it.  To get the full description
say "look".
#157
Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as
tough as that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your
blows effortlessly.
#158
The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully,
and tosses it back, declaring, "Good workmanship,
but it's not valuable enough.".
#159
The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
#160
The troll refuses to let you cross.
#161
There is no longer any way across the chasm.
#162
Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath
the weight of the bear, which was still following you around.
You scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge 
collapses you stumble back and fall into the chasm.
#163
The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a
startled shriek and scurries away.  The bear soon gives
up pursuit and wanders back.
#164
The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get
at it.
#165
With what?  Your bare hands?  Agains HIS bear hands??
#166
The bear is confused;  he only wants to be your friend.
#167
For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
#168
The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems
to calm down considerably, and even becomes rather friendly.
#169
The bear is still chained to the wall.
#170
The chain is still locked.
#171
The chain is now unlocked.
#172
The chain is now locked.
#173
There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
#174
There is nothing here to eat.
#175
Do you want the hint?
#176
Do you need help getting out of the maze?
#177
You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
#178
Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?
#179
There is a way to explore that region without having to
worry about falling into a pit.  None of the objects
available is immediately useful in descovering the secret.
#180
Do you need help getting out of here?
#181
Don't go west.
#182
Gluttony is not one of the Troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
#183
Your lamp is getting dim.. You'd best start wrapping this up,
unless you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall
there's a vending machine in the maze.  Bring some coins
with you.
#184
Your lamp has run out of power.
#185
There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you
can't explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call
it a day.
#186
There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
As you turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a
bearded pirate.  He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me
timbers!"  he cries, "I've been spotted!  I'd best hide
meself off to the maze and hide me chest!".  With that,
he vanished into the gloom.
#187
Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for
those batteries.
#188
Your lamp is getting dim.. I'm taking the liberty of replacing
the batteries.
#189
Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.
You'd best start wrapping this up.
#190
I'm afraid the magazine is written in Dwarvish.
#191
"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure
chest."
#192
Hmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10
points to read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
#193
It says, "There is something strange about this place,
such that one of the words I've always known now has
a new effect."
#194
It says the same thing it did before.
#195
I'm afraid I don't understand.
#196
"Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!"
#197
You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it
shatters into a myriad tiny fragments.
#198
You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the
ground.
#199
You prod the nearest Dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes
one look at you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
#200
Is this acceptable?
#201
There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.

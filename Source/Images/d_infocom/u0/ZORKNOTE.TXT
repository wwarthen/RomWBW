     The following article describes how to configure the game Interpreters
(COM files) included with this distribution. Specifically this allows
the terminal control codes to be changed to your specific needs.

Additional to the addresses below, the following address is relevant

02D0h	File name extension of the data file
	must be 3 bytes long, fill with ascii spaces (20H)

The following link containing the interpreter source code is also useful:

		Customizing INFOCOM(tm) Games
		notes on CP/M addresses

     I don't know wheather or not this is a duplicate effort, but since
I haven't found a similar listing.......

     When I first saw that Infocom was selling off all their CP/M compatible
games for only $14.95 I was overjoyed. Now I could buy all the titles that
I always wanted but could not really afford. Atlast, guilt free software.

     I ended up buying Zork1 for the Osborne I, Zork2 and Zork3 for the DEC
Rainbow, and Wishbringer for the Kaypro II. (My computer system is an Ampro
Little Board with Teac 55b and 55f drives. The terminal emulates a DEC
VT100. With my current hardware I can read or write to almost any 5.25"
format.) I thought everything was going to be so simple, use MULTIDSK and
MCOPY to transfer the programs to Ampro format and away I go! Wrong answer.
Although all the programs would execute, the terminal was confused beyond
belief.

     Some rainy day time with all the .com files and a trusty debugger
got me all the data I needed to unconfuse the terminal and allow me to
customize the display to just the way I wanted it. Now I'd like to 'share
the wealth' with anyone else bitten by the Infocom bug.

     The program starts off with an initial jump to 0200h, the start of
the actual program code. Next comes all the good stuff;

0103h	Charactors per line
	a 78 charactor line is 4Eh

0104h	Lines per screen
	a 23 line terminal (excluding status) is 17h

0105h	File name of the data file without file extent
	must be 8 bytes long, fill with ascii spaces (20H)
	if you have ZORK1.dat then 'ZORK1',20h,20h,20h goes here

010Dh	Screen LF after CR (1 = yes;0 = no)

010Eh	Printer LF after CR (1 = yes;0 = no)

010Fh	Inverse video offset
	if you can add a 80h to the ascii charactor value to get
	inverse video, this byte's for you

           The following strings start with a one byte charactor count,
           the charactor string, and then a null fill (00H)

0110h	Terminal init. string
	Clear screen, move cursor to lower left, set scroll region
	VT100 = 12 1b 5b 32 4a 1b 5b 32 33 3b 31 48 1b 5b 32 3b 32 33 72 00

0131h	Terminal reset string
	Put everything back the way it was

0152h	Begin status line display
	Move cursor to upper left and set video attribute (inverse, bold, etc)

0173h	End status line display
	Move cursor to lower left and reset video attribute

0194h	Printer init. string
	room for anything special you need to set up your printer

0200h	Start of the program code


     I hope you have as much fun with the games as I have had, you can't
beat them at their close-out price. It's unfortunate that they have dropped
their CP/M support, I can't see buying a clone just to play with the
Leather Goddess.
